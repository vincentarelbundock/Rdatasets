# What is this?

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
# url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/master/datasets.csv"
url <- "datasets.csv"
dat <- read.csv(url)
```

`Rdatasets` is a collection of `r nrow(dat)` datasets which were originally distributed alongside the statistical software environment `R` and some of its add-on packages. The goal is to make these data more broadly accessible for teaching and statistical software development. 

# What is included?

The list of available datasets (csv and docs) is available here: 

+ [HTML index](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html)
+ [CSV index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/master/datasets.csv)

On the github repository you will also find the scripts I use to scrape data and update the website. 

# Adding data

Rdatasets only includes data from packages published on the CRAN repository. Please open an issue on the Github repository if you would like me to add data from a new package.

# License

The code in this repository is licensed under GPL-3.

I believe that the R documentation which I copied to the Rdatasets html folder is licensed under GPL. You will find a copy of the GPL in the Rdatasets github repository. 

I made a good faith effort to determine the license under which the actual data (i.e. rows/columns of numbers) were distributed, but I was unable to find a definitive answer. My understanding is that these datasets are free to re-distribute. However, if you own the rights to data that are included here and you object to their inclusion in Rdatasets, send me an email at vincent.arel-bundock@umontreal.ca. I will promptly remove the data in question and will make sure that all traces are erased from the git revision history.
