2,B000EYLDYE,"I absolutely LOVE this dried fruit.  LOVE IT.  Whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I can usually rip open one of these bags and forget all about eating something bad.<br /><br />I've tried every one of their choices but this bag is my favorite.  The apples and apricots are nice and sweet and the peaches give a little tang.  The fruit is also nice and crisp, not stale and bland.  I recommend this mix highly.  Kids love it too so this makes a great lunchbox snack.  Also wonderful for road trips.",great
3,B0026LIO9A,"GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT TOO.  Much cheaper than WalMart and I don't need to lug it home, it appears on my doorstep.  Cats hack up fewer hair balls and instead of adding petroleum products (ie-vaseline) like most HAIRBALL formulas, which causes diarrhea and blocks vitamin absorption, this one has probiotics, which make the digestive tract work better, thus eliminating most of the hairball problem in a healthy way.  (Nothing can prevent 100% of hairball hacking, it's just something all cats do once in awhile.)  A great deal on a great product, plus free shipping when you order over a certain amount.---Coos Bay Sandra",great
4,B00473P8SK,"Great flavor, we go through a ton of this sauce! I discovered it in a local grocery store and then was happy to buy larger quantities on amazon. Excellent quality and adds life to tvp dishes.",great

6,B000FAG90U,"Again, this is the best dogfood out there.  One suggestion:  the bag is a bit hard to get into because the string doesn't pull very easy.  Thanks!",great
7,B006BXTCEK,"The box I received was filled with teas, hot chocolates, and none of the ""Holiday"" flavors advertised.  Not even worth my time to return it.. totally disappointed!  And it took almost 2 weeks to arrive too.  My box contained mainly the Grove Square instant cappuccino/hot chocolate style k cups.  No Gingerbread, Pumpkin Spice or Spicy Eggnog.  The only ""Limited Edition"" flavors I received was Green Mountain Island Coconut. Don't waste your money on this one, not even close to what is advertised!",other
8,B002GWH5OY,This is delicious coffee which compares favorably with much higher priced coffee.  It's a well-kept secret!  Low acidity and smooth taste are hallmarks of this brew.<br /><br />I especially liked the fact that each bag is resealable to keep the coffee at maximum freshness.  I will definitely buy again and again.,great
9,B003R0MFYY,"Don't let these little tiny cans fool you.  They pack a lot of food.  When you dish it out you can see the seafood, vegetables, brown rice. etc.  It smells like it is seasoned and my dogs love it.  I used this quality food to help my little ""portly ballerina"" doxie with her weight problem.",great
10,B001EO5ZXI,"One of the nicest, smoothest cup of chai I've made. Nice mix of spices, largest overtone is the cardamom, but since i do like a half/half of tea with milk or soy milk as my chai drink, this is a good base for me.",great
11,B0001W2XSO,"I'd never heard of these before, but I found a bag at my local liquidation store and decided to give 'em a try. They are among the best plain potato chips I've ever tasted. They have the perfect amount of salt, the perfect amount of curl and the perfect amount of crunch. They really do live up to their own hype.",great

13,B002CJD78E,"I've ordered this food before, and it's one of my dog's favorites.<br />This last shipment, however, contained many dented cans, which does not instill confidence.<br />I'd say about 20% were dented, though so far all the food has been fine.  This is an observation about quality control more than it is a complaint, and I'll likely order again.",other
14,B0027IGAOS,"I love Ghiradelli - and when I couldn't find the chips in my local store, I was delighted to find them online at Amazon.  The chips are fantastic quality, and when I received them in mid-summer in Nebraska (typically 90-100 F) they arrived packaged appropriately were in perfect condition.  The cookies I made didn't last long.",great

16,B0000CERIV,"I love this tea! Who ever thinks of it as cheap should really consider the complexity and the harmony of the flavors that come through with each cup. It may not be the prized white tea, but the nutty taste keeps you wanting more. It's a great part of my tea alternation. I go from something fruity to nutty interchangably. For my nutty trips I consider a cup of Genmai cha and Oolong and for the fruity I recommend a cup of Orange Blossom White Tea. Also try Japanese charry green. Enjoy!",great
17,B001EO6BDG,"We travel to VA frequently. I used to buy these there as favors for neighbors and then have the hassle of getting them back home. Now I just order from Amazon to arrive on the day we get home - the price is much less and no shipping hassles. The quality is excellent, I've tried the Costco version and they are just not as good and nowhere near as good as Planters or others.",great
18,B002CNCAD8,"3/23/11  South New Jersey<br />I've been buying DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Peppers for about six months now.  All I can say is that if you don't have home roasted peppers on hand these grilled piquillo peppers will definitely fit the bill.  These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do ""roast"" my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!",great
19,B001IZM96Y,"I've used brining bags before so when I saw a good price on this 6 pack I thought I was doing myself a favor. I was dead wrong. Thanksgiving eve I went to turn my turkey over and the top opened up completely from the slightest movement. I had turkey brine spilling out into the fridge and all over the floor. Not something I needed to deal with when I was trying to get my pies baked and the table set.<br /><br />If I weren't a pregnant working mom of a toddler I would return these, but I think I will pass them on to some frenemies instead.",other
20,B00086IBHK,"In a word: FUN. You would not believe how a pair of eyes can transform a bowl of ice cream. And if you really get into it (whip cream hair, sprinkles for a beard, candy for the mouth) it can bring ice cream sundae parties to a whole new high. Plus, they taste good.",great
21,B004LO5ECA,Having a puppy means having enough things for him to chew on. I love these bully sticks because they last a really long time and can keep him busy chewing for what seems like forever. Because they last so long they are economical as you don't have to buy them week after week. Bottom line is he loves them and I lvoe that he loves them.,great
22,B001SAU1LE,"We've been fans of Sutter Home Fre wines for years.  They're flavorful, yet nonalcoholic, and low in calories.  They taste like real wine, not like fruit juice.  Fre Brut is a particular favorite.  We like to keep it on hand for guests who don't drink alcohol.",great
23,B001EQ4J1K,"This is a great product.  I've been drinking it almost daily for over 40 years.  Carnation changed the vanilla flavor a few years ago.  They received a complaint from me, and apparently many others, about it. It tasted good, like butterscotch, but I wanted vanilla.  They eventually returned the vanilla to the original recipe.  I use it mostly in protein shakes.  But I do like the occasional frozen mug with just the powder and cold milk.  Remember to put the powder in first.  Always leave enough room to stir vigorously.  Try really hard not to drink it all without coming up for air.  It's hard to do but you can do it.  In other words - savor and make it last.  The energy boost is almost immediate.  I don't use the sugar-free.  Hence the immediate boost.",great
24,B0013GAGUE,"While I agree the taste isn't the greatest, neither is the fat on a body. This is not a product I would recommend switching to if you were simply looking for a jello pudding alternative. You will shock your taste buds! The product is geared for bodybuilders or people used to protein supplements.<br /><br />Another problem is almost as soon as the powder and water merge, it begins to congeal, making it difficult to scrape out of the blender or off the mixer paddles. In other words, you lose a lot of the pudding. However, the powder mix is cheaper than the can contained (premixed) protein puddings I have seen.<br /><br />As far as nutritional value, it is a worthwhile product. (145 cal, 3g fat, 4g carbs, 25g protein) The sodium is a bit high at 550 mg per serving. I usually have one serving if I find my protein is a bit short for the day, so it is not a staple in my diet. I don't think I would be able to eat one every meal or day! I'm leaning more toward obtaining an unflavored protein powder for my low protein days and eat the pudding only once a month or so.",other
25,B000LKX01K,"I like to snack on pumpkin seeds because they pack in a lot of nutrients, but I have never been a big fan of the taste. That doesn't matter a bit with these seeds. The spice is what you notice with these pumpkin seeds: the ""hot"" is pretty darn hot ... not to make you run for a glass of water, but hot enough that you'll want a long drink when you're done. The bags aren't huge, so 15 of them is not a forever supply. I go through 1 or 2 per week eating the ""recommended"" serving size pretty much daily. Good product. Good price. And organic to boot.",great
26,B0002NVL44,"Had some freeze dried mushrooms prior that could be kept in Pantry, very convenient. These recommended to be kept in freezer after opening. Also needed to be soaked in liquid prior to use; NOT convenient. They also had a foul odor.",other
27,B001AY9GHI,"I am so happy Amazon has finally started to ship Hayashi. It is so hard to find here in the US, and when you do find it, it is absurdly expensive and almost expired. This stuff is like a Japanese beef stew. It comes in a block rue form to make what is called Hayashi Rice. All you do is cook some thinly cut beef with some sliced onion and carrots (you can add other vegetables if you wish to experiment) and then add the correct amount of water, bring to boil and add the appropriate amount of Hayashi rue. It has a very smooth taste and tastes as if it originates from a tomato base (but without the normal tangy tomato flavor). Most people pour it on top of Japanese rice like you would Japanese curry. If you're looking for a warm and easy to make meal, this is it. One box of hayashi will serve a large family or provide a small family with enough for two meals. This pack includes 10 boxes so you'll be hard pressed to run out of the stuff quickly (unless you live in my house). The box includes two blister packs of the rue. Each blister pack can be divvied up to make 4 blocks of rue in case you want to make an individual size serving. Each block of the four out of one blister pack is supposed to be equal to one large serving.<br /><br />I ate this stuff all the time when I lived in Japan. It was my favorite dish and my wife would make it for me on a weekly basis. Now I can have it on a regular basis here in the states. Thanks Amazon!",great
28,B008M845PI,Good alternative to coconut oil when oiling your hair.  I usually use coconut oil but will occasionally use this oil for my very long hair.  It moisturizes well and washes out easily.,great
29,B000F5CF8K,"I am officially addicted to coffee, I mean the real coffee which I roast, grind and brew, the first time I had Yiragachefe was when I was deployed to Iraq, my wife neighbors and some other family members knew I really can not live with out coffee, up on my return from Iraq I went to Ethiopian store in San Diego and asked store owner if he has this brand, unfortunately in the USA this brand is sold only by starbucks, but he told me to try some other export standard version of Ethiopian coffee brand, I try 1LB that was my starting point to roast my own coffee, it is almost three years now. That store is on Al-Cajon PVD and I had 15% discount every time I buy my coffee, finally when I moved to East cost I bought 30lb in fear of availability in Louisiana.<br /><br />I am not sure about legitimacy of Indian store in selling Ethiopian coffee but I highly recommend this coffee only if you really know what coffee means, the real coffee comes unroast, and ungrounded 2 shoots of Espresso can keep you moving the whole 8 working hours, this is natural straight from jungle and it's organic no hormone or fertilizer is used to grow it, sadly once it hits our American market it start giving part of its caffeine away to energy drinks and some other things so you will never find real clean and untouched one  on any market but in Ethiopian Stores. I will add some pictures of my newly roasted coffee and show you how easy it is to roast 1.5LB of coffee in about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Please try this unroasted organic you will really like the taste and you will enjoy your day.",great
30,B004WZ4KK0,This is a great cup of coffee! For a regular cup we usually have Nabob and get it through the Subscribe & Save.  The Dark Italian Roast is a keeper and will be replacing the Nabob as soon as Amazon gets the Subscribe & Save going.,great
31,B002GWMGOS,"These are great beans for the price. If you live in a big city, however, I'd suggest buying green beans at a local Ethiopian shop or even a community Coop.

40,B008FVVDIO,"So I saw this at my local Target and thought I'd give it a shot.  I almost decided not to because generally I haven't liked anything but the ""double"" sized T-Discs from Starbucks and the new Gevalia ones that are decent.<br /><br />Anyhow, I brought a package home and tried it out, fully expecting to not like it or to have to stop it half way through to get a decent flavor.  To my surprise, it is very good!  After a having it a few times now, I do try and stop it just short of a full brew for a more robust flavor, but even if I let it go it's still pretty decent.<br /><br />I'll be buying more of these for sure, I'd definitely recommend them.",other

47,B003NYZ8UC,"I must admit that I am only a casual coffee drinker. However, I love nothing more than to relax with a nice cup of coffee after dinner. Kahve Koffee's Decaf Danish blend does the trick for me. Not only did this coffee win several awards in blind taste tests, but it is reasonably priced too! I strongly recommend this award-winning blend for all coffee drinkers. And for those of you, nay-sayers that turn their nose up to decaf coffee, just give it a try, I guarantee that you won't be able to taste the difference.",great
48,B004UKHJQY,"I love these raisins, and sun maid is the best I have tasted so far.  This packaging with the little boxes is perfect to grab and go.  If my energy drops while I am out I just reach in my purse and have just the right snack to keep going.  These also taste amazing, it's a good thing I got them in this packaging, I can see myself easily just eating the whole bag.  I have even converted my husband, instead of a candy bar I give him a box of raisins instead he loves them and with fewer calories it has helped in his quest to lose weight, he is down 30 pounds so far.  Just from cutting back in these little ways, I have also lost 40 pounds and the raisins are good for you, kind of like concentrated wine to me.  I was having liver problems and switching to these type of snacks along with exercise has cured my liver ailment.  I say try them to anyone, my husband was a chocolate bar, I hate yogurt guy and he loves these yogurt covered raisins.  Recommend them to everyone when they ask about our change in diet.  I know they aren't perfect the sugar in the yogurt is high.  My one and only recommendation to sun maid is to find a sugar free yogurt the raisins are sweet enough.",great
49,B003HTXCLU,"Excellent product.  All natural ingredients (real lemons crystalized into powder form) and only 5 calories (sweetned with Stevia).

51,B001G0MBU0,"I have ordered 2 of them one after another and both ""Jamones"" arrived on time and in perfect condition. Campofrio is not considered in Spain a gourmet Jamon but it is a very well known brand that consistently delivers an excellent quality.

52,B005HQSK4K,"On the advice of a friend (whose taste in whiskey is now suspect) I purchased a bottle of Amrut Single Malt (peated).  I am generally partial to single malts with a strong peat flavor - I was a fan of Loch Dhu when it was still available. This whiskey, on the other hand, is overpriced about $80 in Washington D.C.) and over-rated. The peat flavor was overpowering - and it tasted less like peat than artificial smoke. The whiskey tasted far too young, very rough, no depth or real scotch character. I drank a few ounces over the course of this week, and finally could take no more. For the first time in my life I poured a whiskey down the sink. A waste of money, but really no use trying to drink the undrinkable.",other

57,B000660LZC,"This delectable brew always reminds me of eating in a Chinese restaurant where this black tea is served, rivaling in popularity with green tea. The taste is smooth and mellow, absolutely delicious with some sugar and even tastier when chilled. There is no harshness and no aftertaste and this would please even the most finicky tea drinkers. I used to make two or three cups of it, and leave them in the kitchen only to return later to drink the cool, silky tea. Also wonderful with milk or lemon, this black tea is my second favorite after The Prince of Wales also from Twinings and even though they are both black teas, they taste little differently. Oolong is my everyday drinking tea but it's delicious enough to be served to guests or to sip a steaming mug of it on a rainy afternoon.<br /><br />I have tried other brands of Oolong, but so far this is the gentles and less metallic and smoky tasting than others. I am drinking it now with some fried rice as I type, and in my mind I am ready to have a refill or two. For those still stuck on Lipton and Tetley this is the tea they need to change to, for the price is not high and the taste is absolutely fantastic. This is one tea not to be missed, as it's delicate and smooth, and so much more than just ""tea"".<br /><br />- Kasia S.",great

The Italian Herb-flavored variety is a little ""busier"" to my taste.  Although I haven't tried them with a glass of wine, I'm sure they would be a BIG hit at a party where wine is served.  I enjoy them all by themselves, slowly savoring the flavor, chewing small bites to make them last longer!  Also, it's possible the batch of Italian Herb-flavored Parmesan crisps I received might be a little stale, affecting my enjoyment of them, as opposed to what seemed like a fresher batch of Rosemary-flavored Parmesan Crisps.

Cold right out of the freezer or heated up in the microwave.<br /><br />When I heated up this muffin top in the microwave, it just wasn't as good and wasn't really much more than a single mouthful.<br /><br />Hey, Udis...I like your other stuff, so please go back to the drawing board and add more chocolate?",other
72,B005TJK8M2,"I like dried fruits, both as a snack and as an item to pack with my noontime work lunches. Plus, I almost always take them along when I go on camping trips. Nutritionally, they offer almost all the advantages of fresh fruit, but they don't require refrigeration and have a long shelf life if the bag seal is maintained. Typically, I buy the dried fruits in large bags and dole them out in smaller portions from there.<br /><br />Yesterday, I was in my favorite warehouse store and found a large bag (22 ounces) of Kirkland Signature Dried Mangoes and Cherries. Mmmmm, That ought to be good. Two different kinds of mangoes and two different kinds of cherries. Well, they're delicious! Nice mix of flavors. Fresh and chewy with a nice sweet and fruity taste. Yum! These won't last long!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",great

75,B00020UGN4,"If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",great
76,B0025UK10C,"I've loved the taste of bubblegum since I was a kid, but I don't need all the sugar that is in bubblegum and so have avoided it for the most part, as an adult.  I was happy to see that my favorite brand had a sugar-free variety and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />For sweetening, it uses five different artificial sweeteners: sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, aspertame, and acesulfame potassium.  There are 3 grams of sugar alcohols in one piece, which seems like a lot.<br /><br />The taste seems very much like the original, sugar-sweetened product.  The pieces strike me as being a little smaller than the original.  I have not tried blowing any bubbles, but I suspect one would need more than one piece for that.  Like the sugar-sweetened version, the flavor does not last very long but, unlike the original, once the flavor has worn out, there seems to be a vague, off-putting, somewhat-sour flavor left behind -- the only reason I dropped a star on the rating.<br /><br />Being that it is sold here in packs of 12-boxes, I will be chewing for awhile.  It doesn't quite make me feel like a kid again, but I am enjoying it like I did as a kid.",other

88,B000P664X6,"If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />We miss shakes and ice cream and this is a good flavor to use to make such a treat. Put one to two tablespoons of this flavoring into a blender add 6 to 8 ounces of skim milk, a couple of tablespoons of vanilla sugar free pudding, and � cup of crushed ice. Blend this until smooth and you have a good tasting dietetic fruit smoothie that makes a good snack.  It tastes like a dreamsicle. You can even freeze this and have a sort of dreamsicle ice cream treat. We also used to add in a vanilla protein mix that we would add into one of these to make a light meal.  You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!",great

A vet suggested Wysong C-biotic for the pro-biotics, but I believe it also has digestive enzymes that our dog may have been missing. Our older dog had terrible allergies. She was on a variety of meds and even received regular allergy shots.  Adding this to her meals made a significant difference.  It didn't make sense to me, but her old vet (who is not very holistic) said it made perfect sense.  The immune system is based in the gut, and it is the immune system that goes haywire and creates allergies.

Less than 24 hours turnaround time for only $4.99 shipping!  Totally worth it.  Product was packaged well and arrived in great condition.  And did I mention, in less than 24 hours?!?!  I'll be buying from Wag.com again.  :]",great

138,B001SAU9B6,"Disclaimer: I'm a huge tea-drinker and tea-lover! However, I don't like teas that are too bitter or astringent-tasting.<br /><br />Puerh tea (pronounced ""POO-air"") can be either green or black, which is really confusing. This one in particular is a green that tastes like a black! Puerh must be gathered from very old tea plants, which is partly why it tends to be quite expensive. Puerhs are supposed to be very strong-tasting, but this one is relatively mild.<br /><br />This Magnolia Puerh tastes very, very floral, almost like a jasmine, but is also very mild. It steeps up light, so don't over-steep thinking it needs to darken and turn it bitter. (Any tea will bitter if over-steeped due to the tannins.) The mouth-feel is light and silky, and it's very floral and aromatic. I do not agree with the product description that the flavor ""changes with every sip"", but it does take on a very faint citrusy flavor if you let it sit for 10 minutes before drinking. It is only enhanced by honey and milk.<br /><br />If you like Jasmine tea, you would be very likely to enjoy Numi's Magnolia Puerh tea. It's also a good choice for someone who loves black and floral, and wants to gradually ease into drinking more greens.",great
139,B000LKWW1O,"I bought this tea without reading any reviews or any knowledge of the Ceylon Tea Company and I'm happy I did.<br />First off, the price is very reasonable for a tea from Sri Lanka. Second, free shipping is offered for this product, reducing the cost even more. But the most important point about this tea is the taste, that is why I'm writing this review.<br />When I opened the package, the smell of bergamot and tea was great. The bags come in a foil package inside of a box, they are not individually wrapped. I boiled (not quite a boil... probably around 200 degrees) up some water and let the tea bag sit for 3 minutes. What I got was very aromatic, nice and dark and the taste was outstanding. What a treat. I have tried different steep times, and really, this tea is hard to mess up.<br />I highly recommend this Earl Grey and will definitely buy again.",great

I love the mouth-feel of rice noodles anyway, and wide is just that much more fun. Plus, they are not flimsy (like rice vermicelli), so are easy to stir-fry. I use a simple Cantonese style, with some soy sauce, some oyster sauce, and a little beef stock. Be sure to use plenty of oil when you stir-fry, as the noodles do absorb it. But your dish will be so beautiful, it's so worth it. Lastly, if you are on a no-gluten diet, you are gonna go ga-ga over these!<br /><br />The directions on the package for presoaking are good--but instead of warm tap water (which has more lead in it from the pipes!) use cold water and warm it in the microwave. Be sure your noodle container is large enough so that the noodles won't stick to each other too much (and you will have to stir from time to time--again, to keep them from sticking). If you have to do something else, you can store the partially softened, drained noodles in the fridge--they'll be fine when you get back. Then saute as usual. Serve quickly so that the noodles don't get mushy. Voila! A fabulous and easy meal with minimal work (just a little advance effort).",great

Still, I do absolutely wish that they could make a bigger version for snacking on. It is worth a try overall though.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-",other

Luckily, they're not too salty. The sauce is very spicy for a mass consumer product, but for dedicated heat/pain folks, I'm sure these fishies will be almost mild. Frankly, I was surprised by how decent these fish were for the price compared to some of the other cut-rate sardines I've tried.

The shaker lid has holes too large in diameter, allowing the rice to fall out.

Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings.

This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us.

260,B000W283DC,"Quaker Oats may not be the most exciting thing I could review, but it's so incredibly good for your health that I decided to submit this review anyway. Oatmeal has apparently been around in one form or another for goodness knows how long; and the Quaker Oats brand of oatmeal is probably the best you can buy.<br /><br />The oatmeal is easy to make; you can make it on the stovetop with either milk or water (water is healthier); alternatively you can prepare it in the microwave as I do. There are instructions for stovetop cooking on the packaging. If you want to make it in the microwave, pour a serving (1/2 cup dry) into a bowl, add some water until you're satisfied with the amount of water in the bowl and just pop it into the microwave. I find that 2 � minutes in the microwave makes a great hot breakfast that's very healthy for me; and that's doubly important for me as I am on a very strict diet. I must lower my weight and cholesterol to avoid even more health problems that I already have. Sigh.<br /><br />The oatmeal has a slight amount of fat; the total fat is 3 grams per serving. There is no cholesterol; and there's no sodium which makes this a better choice than Cheerios if you're watching your sodium intake. The dietary fiber is relatively high; there are 4 grams of dietary fiber per serving.<br /><br />If you have any questions about just how much oatmeal you need in your own specific diet, ask your doctor. Sometimes eating extra oatmeal--for example, having two portions instead of one every morning--doesn't necessarily mean you're getting twice the value of this product. Again, please ask your doctor or nutritionist to be sure.<br /><br />In addition, the containers usually last a little over a year--look at the packaging for the expiration date and eat the oatmeal before that time.<br /><br />Overall, this oatmeal by Quaker Oats is just about the healthiest choice for your daily breakfast or any other time you wish to eat it.<br /><br />Enjoy!",great

The labeling (all in German) claims this packet makes 4 portions--but they're very generous portions; our family of 3 had more than enough to satisfy everyone, and enough left over for lunch the next day.<br /><br />Basic directions (again, in German) are printed on the back, to wit: cut a pound of meat (beef, pork or poultry) into cubes and brown in hot oil.  Add about 1 1/2 c. water, bring to a boil, add contents of the packet and return to boil.  Cover, turn to low and cook 60-90 minutes, or until meat is tender.  (Or cook in a 400 degree F oven.)  Serve with potatoes.<br /><br />Each packet also offers another recipe; ours had ""Budapest-style"" goulash on the back.  Here's how that one goes: cut about a pound of pork stew meat into cubes and brown them in oil.  Add a generous 1 1/2 c. water and the contents of the goulash spice packet.  Bring to a boil, cover, turn to low and cook for about an hour.<br /><br />In a separate pan, cook about 2 ounces bacon until crisp.  Drain off nearly all the fat, then add two chopped onions and two chopped bell peppers (red and/or green) to the pan.  Saute for 10 minutes, or until the onions start to take on some color.  Add these to the main pan along with 2 or 3 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced (or use whole canned tomatoes, cut up), and cook another 10 minutes.<br /><br />We served this goulash over rice.  The original called for it to be served with potato dumplings, which would also be excellent.",other

This item appeared to meet that criteria.  Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it was not only berries, but also oil and sweetener.  Instead of plumping up when rehydrated in my morning milk, they did not change at all.  They were much more a sweet snack than a true blueberry flavor.  If you are looking for a ""sweetened blueberry with oil"" snack, this might be for you, but if you are looking for ""dried fruit"" as in dehydrated fruit, this is definitely not it.",other

276,B000UY0JUC,"I decided to purchase this balsamic after reading a few good reviews.<br /><br />From what I heard from a few people, I expected much more.  This is a watery vinegar and does not cling to your food like the better balsamics. I put a couple drops on some cheese and they instantly rolled off onto the plate. It's also much more sour than I expected.  The bottle should have a smaller opening as it drips down the side and pours out too quickly.  I'd recommend ripping out the plastic piece and dumping it in a cruet.<br /><br />It is smooth as some others have said and does not leave a bad aftertaste.  I think I'll save this for cooking and dressing rather than drizzling on food.  I imagine it would make a good reduction.  It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning.  You don't need a lot.<br /><br />It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will.  If you like thinner, tangier balsamics then this may be for you.  I'd consider this more of a recipe ingredient than a condiment.<br /><br />The Amazon price is also on the high side.

At $44+ you can't eat this bread too fast, even though it is light. As I got to the last three loaves, I noticed mold on most of the slices. I hoped none was tainted that was already eaten. It was well before the expiration date. I now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again. The Ener_G company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves.

337,B0080C963W,"You don't have to be Greek to enjoy this fabulous white. I often find it hard to interpret professional wine reviews so I will provide the simplest evaluation possible. Imagine an excellent Savignon Blanc with a mild citrus taste but slightly sweeter. That is what you experience with the 2011 Santorini Sigalas Assyrtiko. It is an excellent white wine to serve at a gathering,  with or without hors d'oeuvres.<br /><br />If you have never had an assyrtiko or moschofilero, they tend to be slightly sweeter than most mainstream whites from California or Australia but are a long way from dessert wines.  To the American pallet, Moscholifero tends to have overall stronger taste than assyrtiko. Of all of the Greek white wines I have tasted, this is the best. Friends agree.  It is also a solid value at the 20 dollar price point. Incidentally, this wine is one of the highest rated ever by major reviewers -- 93 points by the Wine Advocate.<br /><br />Greek wines often haven't been well received in the US by non-Greeks.  From what I have experienced, there are a handful of truly awful Greek wines that simply taste nothing like mainstream white wines.  These extremes have tainted reviewers and dissuaded consumers from exploring Greek wines. This wine is a example of something mainstream consumers and connoisseurs alike can enjoy - either with dinner or while entertaining.",great

I'm ordinarily not a fan of vanilla or hazelnut, so I made sure that this was one of the first I tried to get it out of the way.  But there is a high likelihood that I might order more.  I norally don't like my coffee bitter, but this bitterness was absolutely delicious.  And as I noted, the aftertaste left my mouth feeling almost refreshed.

341,B0049MABWW,"[Edit to add: A friend stayed at my house for a week recently and said ""This is the most delicious tea I've ever had in my life.""  She's a huge tea fan, so that is definitely saying something.  So, I've upped my star rating to a 4 (that's the average of my opinion (3) and her opinion (5)).  In light of her reaction, this tea may well be worth a try.]<br /><br />Original review:<br />I live in Japan where we drink oolong tea daily.  I usually buy my flavored teas in the US, because here in Japan they emphasize the aroma of the tea as it is brews rather than the taste, whereas in the US they emphasize the quality of the taste over the quality of the aroma.  This offers nothing outstanding in either area.  The aroma is present but nothing fantastic, and I can't taste the apricot in this at all.<br /><br />This is an upper medium-grade oolong tea, not the delicate high-grade Chinese oolong I was expecting at this price.  This is important because oolong tea is stunning when high-grade, perfectly nasty when low-grade, and merely OK when medium-grade.  It's upper medium-grade, so still very good, but not the stunning flavor I was expecting at this price.  (On reflection, perhaps the high price comes from the fact that it is organic, rather than from using only the highest-grade tea leaves.)<br /><br />Visually all the teas from this series are very appealing and they are ready to give ""as is"" if you need a housewarming gift, gift for your child's teacher, etc.  The package closes securely so you don't need to worry about the tea leaves not keeping well.",other
342,B000PC47WK,"Torani, the flavored syrup often presumed to originate from Italy, but actually manufactured in South San Francisco (""The industrial City""--their motto, not mine) makes many delicious flavors, and hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />The hazelnut refers to any nuts from the species of the genus Corylus. While raw hazelnuts can have a bitter taste, their culinary uses are many, extending from common pralines and other candies (including ""NUtella"") to the rarified confections of Europe, such as the justly famous Viennese hazelnut torte. Hazelnut is no stranger to the coffee house scene,  and when mixed with vodka, hazelnut liqueurs (Frangelica, most famoulsy) enjoy widespread popularity , both straight and as a topping.  Even hazelnut butter is making a stand in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />ALl this is to say that adding hazelnut syrup to your coffee (especially) or perhaps to ice cream, can be vigorously defended against specious attack by foodies: It enjoys a widespread and international esteem.  Torani'z hazelnut is a non-alcoholic sweetner whicih imparts discernable hazelnut flavor, and it can add a great deal of depth of flair to an otherwise ordinary coffee drink.  It's not as sweet or one-dimensional as the Vanilla flavor, although a higher ratio of hazelnut to sugar would certainly improve the experience. It's relatively inexpensive, so that you can find your favorite flavors for various concoctions. A nice bright bottle, too, often left out for display purposes in the unpretensious bohemian caf&eacute;. There will be those black coffee drinkers, gloating over rejected poetry and stinking Galois, who will scorn the use of such a sweetener; it is perhaps best to leave then alone.",great

So I decided enough is enough and I am making sure you know about it before you go through quick check out(worst way to go!) or having to go back after having spent so much time online comparing prices just to find at checkout that you can't afford it because of such excess shipping charges.",other

As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.

415,B003NCIDFG,"My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more ""crumbly"", i.e. there is a lot more ""food dust"" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called ""Simply Nourish"", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing ""Innova Cat & Kitten"", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!",other

I was a bit concerned that the K-cups would disappoint, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the 3 smallest brew sizes before I found a trick that works for me.  I double-brew one K-cup on the smallest setting.  By this I mean that I run the water through 1 K-cup twice, both times on the smallest size which makes a large cup that for me is about the right strength and flavor.

426,B0072MWJ80,"A nutritionist recommended Kashi products and bars to me.  When you want a little bit of chocolate, these don't quite replace a Snickers Candy Bar or Chocolate Chip Cookie, but they come close enough for me.  They're a non-guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is good for you, say health experts.  These also pack 5g protein and 4g(15%) of fiber.  Only 8g of sugar (a Snickers candy bar has 28.8 g of sugar by comparison or almost 4X the sugar of these Kashi bars--nutritionists say your body burns sugar BEFORE fat as it's easier to burn so your body will keep the fat.) These are only 120 calories per bar vs. 280 calories in a Snickers bar--not to pick on Snickers but it demonstrates why these are healthier than most candy bars.  I like to take them in the car when I'm running errands and need something to tide me over, or they're a tasty after-meal treat.<br /><br />A confession: I grabbed this box by accident at the grocery store thinking I was buying this Kashi bar: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B002DHNIBG"">Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bar, Dark Mocha Almond, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> which is my absolute favorite.  I generally like my chocolate straight-up and not mixed with fruit.  However, as an alternative, the cherry taste is refreshing although I think the dark chocolate taste, which I love, is stronger in the other bar with the almonds.  Family members may prefer this one, however.  So, it's great to have two healthy treats in the house that are better nutrition than a candy bar or cookie.<br /><br />If you like the taste of cherry with chocolate, you may want to try these bars.",great

435,B001TJTIJU,"Epoisses is not well known.  For those of you who know what washed rind cheese is, this is one of the greats.  For those of you who do not, this is a class of cheese that is strong.  So do not serve it as the only choice for the uninitiated.  Better to serve at least the classic three choices, one sheep, one goat and this for the cow.  You know, half a Noah.<br /><br />If you are trying it for yourself for the first time, here are a couple of points:<br /><br />- take most of the top crust off, gently with a sharp paring knife and fork.  Not deep.  The crust is soft.<br /><br />- let the cheese come to room temperature (this is a creamy almost soupy cheese and looses most of its taste if cold and firm)<br /><br />- serve with a small spoon, no bigger than an espresso spoon.  (caviar spoons work.  in a pinch, the handle of an ice cream bar works.  The point is not to have big glops extracted)<br /><br /> - good on bread.  Bath Oliver crackers are good.  Water crackers or cream crackers.<br /><br />Wine is essential.  The first time I had this cheese, I had a shmear on a piece of bread.  Wow, the cheese was extraordinary.  Then I had a mouth wash of white wine.  Then the cheese opened into the transformational moment of perfection.  True Sartori.  So always serve with cool white wine,  The fat and alcohol mate to explode all the hidden flavors.<br /><br />My choice is a Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru.  But since I cannot pay for my choice, I am reduced to mere extacy  with a good chalky, flinty Frascati.  For American wines, the new style of lean, un-oaked chardonnay works.  You might better reach for a Fume Blanc otherwise.<br /><br />If you are interested but not quite comfortable, then go for the plain Epoisses, not the creamy.  It is a gateway cheese, as we pushers say.<br /><br />Finally, this is a fair price to pay.",great

I've tried different types of flavored salts but they always seemed to be too strong, imbalanced toward one particular flavor, chemically, or otherwise just plain weird.<br /><br />Because of that, I didn't have high expectations for this product, but the reviews were persuasive, and I did want to have a product of this type for convenience.<br /><br />Upon receiving and trying it, after the first use I realized this would be a staple in my pantry.  What a great seasoning product!  It's hard to define it because this product is nicely balanced and I would say subtle while still being quite effective even in a small amount.<br /><br />I want to point out also that this isn't overly salty, which is GREAT.  I don't use salt much on my food - mainly only on certain items.  Because of that, I tend to favor specialty gourmet salts (since I don't burn through them so fast as to make the expensive price an issue).  Specialty salts tend to have a lot of punch but remain discrete.  In other words, they don't turn the entire dish salty so much as distribute some salt here and there.  This variation keeps the palate invigorated with less actual salt used.  Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt seems to work in the same way.  You don't need much, and while it adds some salt flavor, it's not overkill.  Likewise, the other ingredients in the mix are very nicely balanced such that you have a great blend that seems to enhance the food it's added to rather than dominating it.<br /><br />I wish I would have tried this product sooner.

481,B005MZ6U7K,"I was feeding a very high quality food, but something in it was bothering my 2 oldest Cavaliers.  They were getting grumbly stomachs too often for my liking (about twice a week or so).  So I started looking for another food with a smaller ingredient panel and lower fat, higher fiber.  I also use canned and dry.  I remembered that I had used Mulligan Stew cans in the past and the dogs loved it and did very well on it, so I started researching the food and company to see if I felt they met my standards as a trustworthy company.  I love the science behind the food.  They don't use any synthetic vitamins/minerals and after finding out that they use no Asian sourced ingredients, the kibble is baked so it's more digestible, the ingredient panel for both kibble and canned is smaller, and the company representative Diane was a dream to work with and very knowledgable I decided to order a 5lb. bag to try (I used an amazon gift card I had).  When the bag came, I transitioned them immediately (using probiotics and enzymes to help).  It went great!  I still used the Fromm Gold canned food (until I could order in some Mulligan Stew cans) and the Mulligan Stew dry.  They ate it like candy!  I couldn't wait to see if the grumbly stomachs continued and if their stool looked okay.  Well, after about 4 days they've not had a stomach episode at all, their stool is normal, they eat it up like it's candy and my oldest Cavalier is actually acting a little more lively.  I'm sure her stomach was hurting before.  Needless to say, I'm ordering a larger order of the kibble and some cases of the canned.  Mulligan Stew seems to be the ticket for my dogs' good health.  Thanks!",great

The marinara sauce has an unusually strong flavor, one which may or may not be to your personal liking.  I disliked it mostly because I found it distinctly sweet (the ingredients include sugar and high fructose corn syrup).  As it also contains vinegar, the taste is reminiscent of a Chinese sweet and sour sauce.<br /><br />If you are looking for a convenient, very light snack with a strong and unusual taste, you might give this a try, but I would want less sugar in the sauce and more filling in the ravioli before I tried it again.",other

I completely understand that, this is an evidence world and honestly speaking, a bottle of apple juice doesn't cost that much of money (maybe $5?).<br /><br />But the main problem is, if there is a fly inside of the bottle, is that mean the whole container be polluted during processing by the fly in the factory?

557,B0071JEMIE,"My baby skipped the purees and would not touch rice cereal. These puffs were one of her first solid foods when she was about 7 months. They are puffed up air things which easily dissolve in the mounth so there is no choking hazard. Most of what is in the container and puffs is air, so don't expect a lot of nutrition out of it. The container has 6 half cup servings of 25 calories. My little one got far more servings out of it. It is just to get them used to solid stuff, not to fill them up. Unlike the rice cereal, my little one liked these rice based puffs. The vanilla puffs have cute little star shapes. Not looking at the label of the container, my husband popped open the lid and ate half the container. He freaked out once I told him he ate baby food but said it tasted pretty good. I tried a few and I must say they are fairly sweet and not bad tasting at all. They are much sweeter than the HAPPYBABY brand puffs and that sweeter taste is preferred by my sweeth-tooth baby and hubby. The disadvantage of these puffs is that they tend to stick. Babies put their fingers in their mouth and end up with drooly fingers.

560,B001L4JEXS,"I decided to try these Cedrinca candies mainly because they are eligible for free shipping (many of the ""gourmet"" products are not).  They are REALLY GREAT, and have the most intense honey flavor of any filled or unfilled honey candies that I have tasted.  The filling consists of quite a dollop of honey, so the candies are fairly large, and for a hard candy addict like myself, it's not practical to suck on them when I'm trying to carry on a conversation, or just have a hard candy discreetly in public.  For those situations I would recommend the Go Naturally honey candies, which are much smaller, and also eligible for free shipping.  In fact, the Cedrinca honey candies are so addictive that I keep them in an inconvenient drawer, so that I have time to think ""do I really need another one?"" before getting them out. On the downside, in addition to sugar and honey, the Cedrinca candies do contain ""glucose syrup,"" which according to Wikipedia is the same as corn syrup (I don't know if it's high-fructose corn syrup or not).  The Go Naturally products contain just ""Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, & Organic Honey"" - so they might be more suitable for people who are trying to avoid corn syrup.",great

593,B001SB44PC,"**UPDATE**<br />There is legal info on their website about the lawsuit.  From their side the calories were pretty close to their claim and the fat content was almost right on, but they didn't use the legal serving size.  They've corrected the label and have to do periodic testing as part of the settlement.  The correction isn't that far from what they originally claimed, but some users of the dressings claim the taste is different, worse, and they must have changed their recipe to make the calories/fat match the labels.  My own experience is that this is still a low-cal dressing and I still really like the taste.  I couldn't really tell a taste difference unless I had an old bottle to compare side-by-side, assuming it is actually different.  The plus for us is that we now know the label is correct, maybe even more reliably so than most other dressings.  So try it and like it, or don't.  I do still suggest not buying by the case, it just doesn't last long enough.  Also watch expiration dates in store carefully, lots of stores not good about rotating and this still isn't a big seller so it's more likely to sit longer.  I'm buying it though.

Each pouch is one combined serving of fruit and vegetable. That doesn't mean one serving of veggies and than one fruit but only one serving made up of both. The taste isn't bad at all. My kids inhale them as soon as I ration out their daily allowance. I noticed the amount of sugar in these and only allow one a day. My kids would love to drink these all day long if allowed. They pass the kid taste test approval. I subtracted the 5th star and only give a 4 because of the amount of sugar to volume, and that the juice is not 100% juice. I would love to see a Super-V drink with 100% juice and not the 66% it currently has. The Berry is the best tasting one in my opinion, but since we also buy apple, and fruit punch Super-V I notice they all go just as fast when offered to the kids.",other

635,B008UUR5VE,"These are for people that cannot tolerate sugar. They are not low cal, just slightly lower cal. The regular Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels made with sugar average 15 calories per piece or 60 calories per 17.3 grams, which is 4 pieces. The sugar free version averages 12.5 calories per piece or 50 calories per 16.5 grams, which about 4 pieces. Thatt's 20% fewer calories per piece.<br /><br />They are slightly softer as the regular Rios and much less sweet and much less flavorful. In terms of flovaor, there is no comparison -- the regular are rich; the sugarfree are bland, emphasis on the ""bla"". Eating these is a big sacrifice for 20% fewer calories. If you want to reduce caloric intake, the if you can work up the discipline to skip one piece for every 4 you eat, you total enjoyment might be much greater with the 20% fewer calories.<br /><br />They are made with real coffee and milk and Splenda sweetener, and other things.<br /><br />If you have partial fillings or crowns or braces, etc. you will want to avoid chewing these even though the are sotftler than the sugared version.<br /><br />For more general review on the Rio coffee candy, se my review of Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels.",other

These have already been prepared for you but you can still add your own olive oil and any other spices you may like to them. The flesh of these olives after being cured is meaty with a slight bitter to them. They play off the almonds very well. The almonds in this mixture are soft, smooth (almost creamy) and offset the slight bitter in the olive. I prefer to eat one or two olives and then follow up with an almond. You can even eat both simultaneously. The olives do have pits so be careful. Don't just bite down into one or you may damage a tooth. Eat the flesh of the olive off of the pit. I prefer to add some of my own extra virgin olive oil but it is up to your individual taste. This would go great on an antipasta tray or served with some cheeses and maybe some wine.

722,B0070Y9TUG,"I was introduced to this excellent product during the Jewish season of Yum Kippur in December, when my local Ralphs market had a promotion of special foods for that holiday.  It is rare to find bottled salad dressings made with olive oil, rather than canola oil, soy oil, or safflower oil, which are the three major allergens.  Most people don't even realize they have allergies to these oils, but they could have a stomach ache after eating some.  I bought a number of these bottles when they were on special.  I have noticed that the bottles vary greatly with the amount of green flecks enclosed inside the bottle.  Some have a great deal, and others are almost green-fleck free.  I prefer the bottles with more green flecks, but I'm happy enough with those that have just a few.  Clearly, this is one of the very best commercially prepared salad dressings available.  The front label indicates gluten free/dairy free.  The ingredients are simple enough:  water, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cider vinegar, salt, xanthan gum, garlic, onion, potassium sorbate (preservative).",great

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.""<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes.

808,B001EO6190,"For those who haven't experienced torrone almond honey nougat candy, you are in for a treat. This Italian specialty confection is authentic and a product of Italy. Although it looks like it will be hard and/or sticky, it is miraculously soft. Each piece is sealed in foil for freshness and carefully packaged in a small box like a gift. There are eighteen tiny boxes per 6.35 ounce package. When I was a child, after eating the candy, I would keep the little boxes and use them to store special treasures. I have added a photograph to show the individual packaging for each piece of candy.<br /><br />Only 45 calories per piece and 3 grams of fat with only half a gram of saturated fat, as far as candy goes, this is surprisingly natural. The candy is loaded with toasted almonds and flavored with vanilla, orange or lemon.  A distinctive very thin white wafer coats the front and back of the rectangle providing a satisfying lightly crisp texture. Torrone has a short ingredient list with toasted almonds as the first on the list and chemical additives thankfully absent, so there are no artificial colors or preservatives.<br /><br />There is nothing else like this Italian confection.  It is usually reserved for holidays, and I know in my house it wouldn't feel like Christmas or Easter without it, although it is certainly wonderful year round.  Ferrara's torrone would make a lovely hostess gift or an unusual treat to tuck into a Christmas stocking.",great

When you spend $56.00 for 7 different kinds of cereal, that's what you think your getting, not what they have more on hand of at the time. There should be an equal distribution of each kind, and if they can not do this please specify this in the product details so consumers are not mislead.

It substitutes just fine for any recipe requiring minced or crushed garlic.

I am a tea enthusiast and have considerable knowledge and experience with a wide range of teas, and have had better experiences with dried rose buds/petals.  The product's title and description indicated there would be rose BUDS, but I received only petals - not really what I was expecting, and had I known the description were inaccurate I would have passed on the purchase.  I've found rose buds offer a milder taste than rose petals, so the difference is something to be considered if you're familiar with the nuances between the two.  These petals in particular had a spicier taste than what I was looking for, though they do succeed in providing rose flavor.  I find that they're good when mixed with a straight-cut white tea and can last for two steepings before the flavor noticeably diminishes.  Personally, I favor mixing rose buds with oolong tea, but I find that flavor these petals yield isn't hardy enough to last multiple steepings with a darker tea - I tend to add an extra spoonful of them when making darker infusions.<br /><br />I think that for general needs (mine are admittedly specific), this product is adequate - I personally won't purchase them again, though I do plan on using the rest of my bag.",other

A few days later we each brought our new pretzels to one of my daughters softball games to snack on. As I ate mine, my mother insisted I try hers. Oh wow are these garlic parmesan ones good! It's not even a flavor I would normally have thought I would like, as I tend to like simpler flavors. But these are just so good, even a picky eater like myself love them. So on my next trip to the store I picked up 3 bags for myself and I'm snacking on them now.<br /><br />If you can envision a pretzel that has been rolled out flat with a rolling pin, that's what these are like. You get more of the crispy outside and much less of the white flour center you usually have with pretzels. Because they have a flat design, they even work as crackers. So you can top them with cheese, meats etc and use them with dips, just like you would a cracker, only they taste even better. They are very crispy, but don't crumble or fall apart when trying to eat them. The bags are resealable, and the seal works extremely well. The best part is since they have so much flavor, you can eat just a few and it feels like you've eaten a lot more. Lots of flavor is a smaller package.<br /><br />The nutritional info is:<br />Serving size: 10 crackers/pretzels<br />Fat: 1.5g per serving<br />Calories: 110 per serving<br />Carbs: 22g per serving<br />Sodium: 410mg per serving<br />And there is a warning that these are made in a facility that processes milk and soy, for those with allergies to them.",great

When I received the product and opened a packet and saw that the kelp was covered with a white dusty substance I was horrified and assumed it was moldy but after reading the instructions--always a good idea!--I was informed that it's normal and is just salt and sugar substances produced by the kelp as it is dried.  This company claims that they voluntarily test for various kinds of contamination, so I was impressed by that. As for eating the kelp, I washed and inspected a piece of it, then snipped it into some chicken broth and gently simmered it for about 20 minutes.  It's a little chewy--imagine a really tough cabbage leaf--and seems salty, but I found it palatable and didn't get sick or anything.  In fact, I felt quite good the next day.  Don't know if that was down to the kelp, but I will keep on eating it.  Try it.",great

In an environment like a Boy Scout camp, where food is mass produced and isn't of the greatest quality, this stuff is essential.  It makes everything palatable, which is great.<br /><br />I didn't find the stuff again for about 10 years, when I was surprised to see it on the shelf of my local grocery store.  What amazed me that although it is excellent in making mediocre food better, it also makes *good* food taste better, too.  I don't use it on everything, like at camp, but it's great for things like seasoning home made french fries or potatoes.  It is a bit salt-heavy, so you should know that ahead of time, but if you like moderately salty foods you'll enjoy it.  If you haven't had this before, get a smaller, single jar before getting the large six pack.<br /><br />You should know that a six-pack of 17-oz jars is a LOT of seasoning, and the expiration date is about 2 years from manufacture - there's almost no way for a single family to eat this much seasoning in that time.

881,B007HP5FLK,"I think there is a wrong description of this tea listed at the moment, this tea is made from the rooibos plant.<br /><br />I bought the tea since I do love the Japanese green matcha tea, but that is so energizing I don't want do drink it at night. Plus I wanted to try something new.<br /><br />I found that there are only about 3 companies who do sell red matcha. I tried this one from Red Leaf Tea since I saw that they had many different types of matcha available, even black and white matcha. So they appear to be matcha specialists! I sometimes cannot wait for my shipment of green tea to arrive from Japan, it takes so long. I was happy to find Red Tea and they are an American company, the shipping was fast!<br /><br />I love the red matcha, it has its own sweet flavor, I liked it without sugar or cream. It is very thirst quenching. I haven't tried it iced, but I read that it is wonderful as an iced tea or iced latte. I only bought the small size so I am conserving. I am using the rest to make just plain, I just add hot water and whisk or stir. It is absolutely delicious without anything added. It foams up pretty nicely also! I should have bought the bigger size from Red Tea. I was trying it for the first time.  Now I have another tea I like as much as green tea matcha!<br /><br />This red matcha is very healthy and FULL of anti-oxidants, even more so than green tea! It is a good tea to drink at bedtime since it is relaxing, but it also makes a good daytime tea.  I think this tea will be revitalizing if you need and relaxing if you want, it is unique.<br /><br />Try this: add some red tea matcha to warm milk or soymilk (any kind of milk) with your favorite sweetener. YUMM!<br /><br />I put some of the matcha in lowfat 1% milk with some vanilla agave syrup (I didn't have plain agave) and then used my espresso machine's steamer to foam the milk and create a delicious dessert.

884,B000CMH0OU,"I am a classically-trained singer with Type I diabetes, and I recently finished up a year learning a little about singing in contemporary styles. Over-singing suddenly became a big problem. I used to use honey in hot water to sooth my irritated throat, but that spiked my blood sugar, which in turn dehydrated me and my vocal folds - and that was completely counterproductive.<br /><br />My voice teacher turned me on to Yogi Throat Comfort, and I haven't gone back.

896,B001MOQI0Y,"I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!",great

934,B000BOS3E0,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",other

936,B0000CER0J,"Earl Gray is my tea of choice; my absolute favorite.  That being said, I have to further state that this Gourmet Earl Grey offered by Adagio is the best of the best!  The aroma is enough to make me swoon.  (Actually, I am pretty good at swooning and many things other than tea cause the condition...I would have made a great Victorian Lady...well, ""Lady"" may be a bit of a stretch, but at least Victorian would be appropriate).<br /><br />Anyway, loose leaf is always the way to go if you have the time and are so inclined.  I like mine on the rather strong side and must admit to enjoying the smell of it steeping almost as much as I enjoy the drinking of it.  The oil of bergamot is not at all overwhelming and is far superior to some of the stuff they add to tea these days...there is not after taste and the aroma does not linger for three days afterwards.<br /><br />Recommend this highly. The price here, when you consider the tax situation and the 50 mile drive I have to take to get to my source, is quite competitive.",great

When I saw that 'For The Gourmet' had Sharp Provolone on their list of available purchases, I was intrigued. I tried it, and boy, am I glad I did. I think it is much better than Parmesan in the tangy-ness and strong-ness you can get from just about any cheese. I think I even like it better than an extra sharp, or seriously sharp cheddar cheese. Although, those are really good, too. It ads so much flavor and you don't have to use much of it. That is why I like Parmesan, but Pramesan is so much harder and dryer. This will melt much better. Don't hesitate to try it. It is really delicious.",great

I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement.

I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.",other

Covering it with a plate or foil does not help. I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over. You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it's cool enough to eat.<br /><br />The texture of this cereal is very grainy, which can not be helped by adding more liquid.

954,B000W5SLB8,"First off, I'd like to note that this would normally be a five star review if I were simply reviewing the product itself, but I am also taking into consideration Amazon by dropping the review by one star.<br /><br />I switched my dogs over to Taste of the Wild Hi Prairie formula when Amazon decided to jack up the price of the Natural Balance formulas I used to purchase (the Bison and Venison ones) by ten dollars.  I was hesitant to spend fifty-five dollars on a bag of food when my two dogs go through almost three bags a month, but the two-day shipping made it seem worth it, particularly since the nearest PetCo (the only store in my area that seems to carry Natural Balance) is almost ten miles of slow-moving traffic away.  However, spending almost seventy dollars on a single bag of dog food is just too much, so I decided it was time to change brands.<br /><br />Luckily, my first choice turned out to be a success.  I swapped my dogs over to Taste of the Wild over the course of three or four days and their stool has remained solid, something that has always been an issue for my Boxer (with Natural Balance being one of the few premium brands that worked well for him).  Really, the only issue I have with Taste of the Wild is that the food smells a bit strong, but when the results are there it's hard to complain much about having to catch a nasty whiff of it a couple of times a day during feeding.  My dogs seem to love it, though, and are eating with a bit more enthusiasm than they did previously.<br /><br />As I said, the score was dropped one star for Amazon's handling of the product.  First, this product actually costs about four dollars more than it does in my nearby store (it is sold in a small, locally-owned dog bakery for $49), which is only a block away.  Second, for whatever reason Amazon does not offer two-day shipping via Prime for this item.  For me, this is the bigger issue, as I typically order a new bag right when I need it rather than stockpiling them.  With the unpredictable nature of standard shipping options, it's almost impossible for me to continue to order this product from Amazon.<br /><br />That said, you can't go wrong with this product if you have dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies.  It's one of the better grain free foods that I've come across and works great for both of my large breeds (a Boxer and a German Shepherd).  Just check in your area and see if you can't find somewhere that sells it a bit cheaper.",other

So having read the reviews I bought these as I love fruity cold drinks.  These do have a lovely fruity flavour.  However, I can see that it may be too sweet for those who were still looking for a green tea taste to balance the sweetness.

It's a good flavor, not acidic, smooth flavorful, coffee. The number 4 is strong coffee, same basic flavor as the number 3, just stronger.  It's like using a full pot worth of grounds and only brewing three quarters of a pot.  My favorite is the number 5.  Number 5 is different.  Number 5 is extremely strong flavor!  Do not use a normal amount of grounds to brew a pot, unless you're really stubborn, you'll dump the pot.  It is good though, if you use about half the normal amount of grounds you get some very tasty coffee that you can actually drink.  I bought three packs of number 3 and 4 for work.  I brought in a bag of number 5 once, but that was a big mistake.

1001,B002IYT3MW,"These tomatoes sounded great because they have no additives or preservatives. They were delivered very quickly, and are a dull brown color, which I expected because of the lack of sulfites.  Unfortunately, they are extremely bitter, and even though I expected the flavor to improve when I rehydrated them with water, they retained the bitterness. I tried soaking them in olive oil as well, and this also did not do much to improve the flavor.  Amazon advertises these as sun dried but in fact, they are not sun dried and are air dried instead.  I don't know if that has anything to do with the flavor, and I was unable to find out any other information about the company, Sonoma. Therefore, I would not recommend these tomatoes. :(",other
1002,B000WUVZCK,"First, my cat loves this treat.  However, it is definitely not a dental product as the manufacturer advertised.  There is no enzyme in Greenies that would promote dental health.  The size of the treat is pretty standard compares to other brands of cat treats, so there is no need for the cat to chew on it (my cat swallows it in 2 seconds), which means Greenies does not ""brush off"" the tartar either.  I took my cat to the vet few months ago for professional dental cleaning.  After the treatment, the vet gave me some handouts about dental care for cats, and explained to me that Greenies does NOT promote dental care.  Instead, the vet recommends the CET chews for cats.  However, the vet says, nothing beats brushing your cat's teeth at least every other day.  So, if you are looking for an oral hygiene chews, look somewhere else, however, if you just want to please your cat, Greenies does make a tasty treat!",other

1012,B004DJ243U,"I bought this tea as a gift for someone who had it at a tea and liked it. Since it came in six canisters, they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark, no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea, no matter how much tea you use, it still stays light and has a grassy, nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it, I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very, very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing, no leaves in sight, just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar, any tea can taste decent. This tea just didn't work for me on any level.<br /><br />You may want to try the Rishi or Bentleys. They are more expensive but they taste better. You may be very underwhelmed by this tea compared to them.",other

1038,B005VTYV0K,"Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity ""candy corn""'aspect one often finds in bourbons.  It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18.  It's lovely.  Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco.  There's some leather and cream too.  First sip opens bright with honeyed corn.  Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect.  Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke.  It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best.  The absence of ""corn likker"" fruitiness is most appreciated.  This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.",other

My wife has a coworker who loves lemon, so this matcha might be hers after another cup or two. It has a lemony bite that someone who enjoys lemons and sour candy might love.

1077,B00317ERW6,"I bought a box of these a few months ago at my local grocery store during my ""let's try the many different varieties of Cheez-Its"" plan.  At first I was unsure how I felt about the smoked ones, but after the box was gone I really craved them.  I love the Monterey Jack ones, but I love the Smoked Cheddar differently.  My brother didn't like the smoked ones, and it certainly depends on your personal taste.  I read a review here that said they taste like a campfire - that is sort of true, but not exactly a bad thing in my opinion.  They taste smoked because they ARE smoked.  If you do not like smoked foods (like my brother) you will not like these, and if you think the sound of smoked cheese sounds bad you really should try another Cheez-It variety.  These are (currently) my favorite Cheez-Its and I hope they continue to make them for a long time.<br /><br />As for the price here right now: that I give a 1 star.  My local grocery store sells these for about $4 to $5 a box (13.7 oz).  I only buy them when they are on sale, usually $2.50 to $3 a box.  The price from Amazon right now is $25 for 4 boxes of the same size, which makes these $6.25 a box.",great

1102,B005Y10ZMS,"Whoa...in doing my research I noticed that one box of South Beach Diet Bar Fiber Granola Bar (that's a mouthful isn't it) costs $23.92 if you order it on Amazon. I have prime but I realize that not everyone does so if you factor in another couple bucks for shipping...ridiculous price. I'm not sure how much a box of this costs in stores (considerably less I would hope) but I daresay that it is unlikely that the price is worth the product. If anyone could use a good diet bar it's me but the problem with diet bars is in the name. They are DIET bars. They aren't supposed to taste great (otherwise you'd be in danger of eating the whole box and what kind of diet is that) so instead they usually taste like a mix of cardboard and...well more cardboard. Now the South Beach Diet Bar Granola Bar isn't THAT awful. Don't take that delicious looking beast on the package for truth. The real product is much flatter...And the taste? Well it tastes exactly what you would think a chocolate diet bar would taste like. It's unfair for me to bash a diet bar based on taste after admitting that diet bars aren't SUPPOSED to taste good but that image on the package really got my hopes up.<br /><br />But how effective is the bar? Effective enough. I ate one this morning and I didn't eat again till later this evening. That's not really praise for the diet bar, I have a pretty hectic schedule. But maybe I didn't notice the hunger as much. I'm guessing I could eat a granola bar (get better taste at a cheaper price) and be the same level as hungry. So if you take diets/diet bars seriously then this might be the bar for you. It doesn't really have anything to separate it from the other snack bars out there other than the South Beach name but hey, what do I know?",other

1110,B009GHI6I6,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",other

If I can drink a tasty drink that is good for me, gives me energy, and makes me think of happy things, well, why wouldn't I? This one is all my grandmother and my father. Every Thanksgiving, my grandmother would let us drink cranberry juice mixed with ginger ale, and we felt so grown up. So grown up! It's still my preferred way of drinking cranberry juice, and when the cranberry ginger ale is released around the holidays, all I do is think of her. Her son, my father, is a ginger ale memory for me too, it's his favorite soft drink. Vernor's, if you've got it, or Schweppes, but Canada Dry will do in a pinch and make him think of me anyway. When my wife is ill, it's ginger ale, if you please, not lemon-lime anything. You know that old adage that girls always search for someone like their father? It's so true in my case...my wife and my father are amazingly alike. So when I spotted it on the Red Leaf tea website, I had to grab it for my campaign to get her to like ginger ale. Who knows, I might convert my dad with it when he comes up to visit next!<br /><br />This is wonderful. Ginger and I are not the best of buddies, but I'm coming around to it. This reminds me of a local ginger ale found only in Middle Kentucky called ""Ale-8-1"". It's full of ginger flavor, but in a very good way. If you get this one, don't be put off by the overwhelming ginger smell, it's not nearly as strong as it smells, which is a good thing to me. It would definitely be a matcha I reach for when I'm headed into work with an upset stomach, but need a pick me up. I don't think it's one I'll keep in stock, but it's not one I'll be actively trying to swap away either. I'm excited to try it with the cranberry. If you're familiar with ginger ale brands, it's more of a Vernor's than anything else. Lord have mercy, I spend way too much time with ginger ale, apparently. But if I can talk my Dad into trying matcha, this will definitely be the one I lead with. Who knows, my father in law greatly enjoyed the French Vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea, maybe my dad can be won over as well!",other

It is definitely the best green tea I have ever tasted---green tea as it always should be---full of flavor and freshness!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 100% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue by providing antioxidants. It contains 58mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee). Note that Yogi makes a Decaf Simply Green Tea, too, if you want to avoid the caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended. In the case of this tea, simplicity is bliss!<br />*****",great

For a<br />two quart stew pot or brasier, add about two ounces of<br />Bittersweet Scharffen Berger Chocolate and a tiny amount of hot<br />pepper.<br />Of course, this is not really a secret-Mole Poblano has used these<br />ingredients for years. But some prejudiced connection of chocolate<br />with dessert prevents us from using chocolate as a spice.<br />Why Scharffen Berger? Here's a story:<br /><br />My European friends are mildly snooty about some of their<br />local products-all of which, in their eyes-are infinitely<br />superior to their American equivalents. A few years ago, I<br />started carrying Scharffen Berger chocolate bars with me to<br />Europe-mostly the blue and yellow wrappers.<br />At one friend's house, I was always asked to make a mousse<br />au chocolate and so I, naturally, used the Scharffen Berger<br />even though my host had put out a local (Austrian) brand.<br />The rave reviews that the mousse got-and continues to get-<br />are not based on the recipe, which is basic basic, but on<br />the remarkable complexity of these lovely chocolates and<br />particularly on their fruity overtones and beguiling winey<br />finish.<br />I hear that the company has been sold to Hershey, and so there<br />is no guarantee that the quality will remain as it is. For the<br />moment, I have to say that I think this is certainly one of the<br />three best chocolates in the world and maybe the best.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, wine writer New Short Course in Wine,The and the rich and velvety bang BANG: A Novel<br />which has decidedly spicy notes of its own.",great

I am glad I got both as well because I contemplated if they would be too similar and not worth the cost of both however as much as I love both flavors, I had to do it and I have no regrets!<br /><br />This Almond matcha is sweet and nutty. The aroma is captivating!! My daughter was in the process of making macrons and decided she will add some almond matcha to them. Unfortunately we had to stop because we were out of parchment paper - can't use waxed .... so anyway off to the store we shall run and I am going to pick up more sparkling water because I want to make an Italian Creme Soda with this almond matcha which will be AMAZING! Frothed up lovely even in milk.<br /><br />I love that Red Leaf uses natural flavors!",great

I did a 180 with their rich, delicious flavor, so I only buy green olives from Spain (and olive oil too!).<br /><br />I was looking forward to trying these, but sadly, I found them to be extremely salty - and not as flavorful as others I've had.They would be good for tapenade, as the previous reviewer stated, or in a pasta sauce, or any ""dish"", as they will add flavor & salt (so you can adjust the final taste), and hold up well, however, I wouldn't recommend them as a superior ""stand alone"" to eat by themselves, which was the primary reason I bought them.

Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes.

He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better.

Additionally the vegetables in the crackers are part of a ""dehydrated vegetable blend"" and the vitamins you would expect to be in many of the vegetables (eg vitamin A in the carrots listed in the vegetable) are not much higher than in normal crackers.<br /><br />Questionable marketing and name aside, the crackers don't taste very good.

1304,B000K4ZA56,I bought these vanilla beans in 2007 and five years later they still made a delicious vanilla syrup. I've used them in other recipes although I found them difficult to open since they seem to dry out a bit. When I make vanilla syrup all I do is cut the beans into half inch pieces. To make a syrup bring two cups water and two cups granulated sugar to a boil. Add in eight cut up vanilla beans. When boiling lower heat so that the syrup is still rolling but more like a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes. You want a bit of the water to evaporate. Then turn off the heat and cover the syrup. Leave it overnight so more vanilla is infused into the syrup. Then strain it through cheesecloth and pour it into a prepared bottle. I use an old vanilla syrup bottle. When you make your own syrup you don't have to worry about preservatives and it tastes way better. You can then drizzle your homemade syrup over fresh fruit or put it in your coffee. Don't expect the syrup to be clear however. The vanilla beans do color the syrup a bit.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,great

Why is it? It is very palatable and obviously very sweet. However, there is none of the high fructose syrup in it that is added to other punches. Afterall, this is 100% juice.<br /><br />So what's in this stuff?:<br /><br />Apple Juice, Grape Juice, Raspberry Juice (Water, Juice Concentrates) Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Citric Acid. It is the combination of juices in this blend that makes this taste like a treat. For children and adults too, who like the sweet taste of soda pop or sweetened punches, this product represents a much healthier and palatable alternative.<br /><br />For providing this excellent, anti-oxidant rich alternative, as a compromise between healthy beverages and sugar sweetened drinks, I feel that ""Juicy Juice Fruit Berry"" has easily earned a five star rating.<br /><br />Now if only there were a way to decrease the amounts of natural sugars without affecting the taste?!<br /><br />WHAT IS THE ""JUICY JUICE"" BRAND?:<br /><br />Libby's ""Juicy Juice Fruit Berry, 46 fl oz"" is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that Coke and Pepsi have carved out for themselves. Their target market is the youth of America. That, more than anything else, makes this and other Libby's products important. I first became aware of this targeting when I was watching the PBS program ""Arthur"" with my youngest child (who is named Arthur). At the end of the show there was a message from Libby's that said, ""Juicy Juice Is Proud To Support Arthur"". Since then I have regularly supported their 100% juice products, although I drink more of them than our Arthur does. Surprisingly, most ""Juicy Juice"" products are significantly less expensive than ""Ocean Spray"" and ""Northland"" juices, though I still buy some of those varieties as well.<br /><br />THE INEVITABLE COMPROMISE:<br /><br />Though many critics and health advocates have pointed out that fruit juices are naturally high in sugar and after processing, including pasteurization, lose many of their healthful properties, they still represent a healthful alternative to soda for children. Surprisingly this seems to be a controversial statement, but 100% juice [with a little Vitamin C added] does help to engender healthful eating habits which begin with the choice of beverage. It is also a good source of potassium and is an excellent thirst quencher.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that all of these juices taste very palatable to kids, probably because they are blended to taste sweet without any added sugar. Of course, it would be better to make your own juice, avoid pasteurization [made in a very clean environment], and include the natural vitamins, minerals and pulp, but who really has time. What's more, do you really think a child would drink such a homemade healthy brew? In the meantime, there is ""Juicy Juice"" and our children will most probably drink that thereby avoiding soda.<br /><br />LOOKING FOR MORE INFO?:<br /><br />To find out more about this product, see their website at ""juicyjuice"" on the world wide web. They have several useful links to pediatric nutrition sites and ""Frequently Asked Questions"" about their products.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT]",great

It's a tomato-based soup with a light dose of rice, black beans, and chicken. It's not thick or chunky. I'd call it a medium-density soup. Enough broth to slurp for those who like a not-stewish soup. Not super hot or spicy, but flavorful all the same.<br /><br />I find that it's very nice on its own, but I prefer it with more black beans (I just add canned ones) and chopped tomato and a sprinkle of low-fat cheddar cheese. That really makes it into a nice light meal, satisfying and flavorful.<br /><br />But I think if you like tomato-based soups and a Mexican vibe, this will agree with your taste buds.

I really didn't notice any other flavor because the salt, for me, overwhelmed the product.<br />Guess I better start saving my $$ for more expensive caviar.",other

1347,B000YYGW18,"I have been eating healthy and using products with Splenda instead of sugar in them for many years. I have been using Aspen Mulling Spices even longer than that. As soon as there is the tiniest hint of cold in the air I start mixing this in to every drink I have. This year, for the first time, I decided to order the sugar-free version and I was extremely disappointed. First off.. while it isn't obvious anywhere in the Amazon ad, it is only 2oz compared to 5.65oz of the original. So nearly 1/3 the amount but for the same price (or even higher). I get if this was 10+ years ago and Splenda was still new and magical and a fad, but there are few other products out there anymore that charge more simply because they're made with Splenda. And to make it even worse, looking on the packaging where it gives you recommended amounts to use for different drinks, some of the amounts it suggests are now higher. For example: 1.5tbsp for Brandy on the original, but 2tbsp for sugar-free. So you'll also be going through this faster. And finally, to me, the taste just isn't the same. I'm not talking about Splenda vs sugar, I don't use real sugar in anything. But the actual product seems to be different. It is an extremely fine powder, closer to the consistency of powdered sugar, whereas the original is more like regular sugar or salt in consistency. Whatever they have done has completely changed the flavor profile to me. And again I'm talking about the taste of cinnamon, of cloves, etc, not how sweet it is. I have been shopping on Amazon for a long long time and this is the first product I have actually reviewed. If you want this healthy-nuts opinion... just order the original and use it in moderation. Just like anything else.",other

1349,B007TFO29Y,"I bought a pound of this Meow Mix Tender Centers for my cat at the local pet superstore near my house. And although she seems to like it, I have to give it a low rating. Here is why:<br /><br />This Meow Mix Tuna and Whitefish Cat Food is like junk food for my cat as it tastes good but has little nutritional value. It has inferior ingredients in the top 5 of the ingredients list (listed below), as well as the addition of artificial colors and controversial brewer's yeast, so no matter how much my cat might like this cat food, I really had to give it a low rating.<br /><br />To start with, the first two ingredients on the list are ground corn and corn meal. These supply no essential vitamins or nutrients to my cat's diet. Chicken by-product comes next, which is a less than ideal form of protein as it is made up of the bits of the chicken that are unfit for human consumption. Salmon meal and fishmeal do provide better forms of protein, but they are not the main ingredients and do not provide a satisfactory amount of protein for a healthy cat. Furthermore, the artificial colors are unnecessary, and the addition of brewer's yeast can cause allergies in cats.<br /><br />Meow Mix, a subsidiary of Del Monte, could have come up with something better!<br /><br />Top 5 Ingredients:<br />1. Ground yellow corn<br />2. Corn gluten meal<br />3. Chicken by-product meal<br />4. Soybean meal<br />5. Beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of Vitamin E)",other

Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item. For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews.

Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.",other

Our three cats don't love this ""dental diet cat food"" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.",other

1438,B001EO6D52,I love this salt. It imparts an intense smoke and salt seasoning flavor to whatever you are putting it on. I paid 10 dollars for the three tins and found it to be pricey but worthy and unique. I don't think I would pay 15 dollars for it though unless you think it critical for a recipe. I smoke my own foods but I would not smoke with this salt on anything. If you grill on a gas barbeque then this may help you achieve smoky flavor and saltiness at the same time. It is good for other foods cooked indoors as well. Again if you barbeque with wood then you might not need this at all. I recommend using this on fish. I also suggest you have a salt grinder as the granules are to the larger size type of salt crystal and reducing it in size helps to avoid heavily salted spots and spread out the flavor evenly.,great
1439,B002LN4KUA,"Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say ""man I can sure go for some raman"", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.",other

The broth is cloudy, rich, and immensely flavorful compared to any soup, not just other instants, but surprisingly light on the tongue and stomach... much unlike the, heavy, bland dollar-a-dozen cardboard noodle. (To emphasize the difference: Top Ramen and Ichiban actually make me throw up now, just because they're too bland and... cardboard... -esque... I can stomach Maruchan if I fill it with my entire spice cabinet.) Bowl Noodle has the same punch as Campbell Hearty when it comes to taste. Two of them fill me perfectly if I'm in desperate hunger. I'll have one for a snack instead of chips because it's a lot quicker and more satisfying.

But now, I have experienced Teeccino, and I love it.<br /><br />All coffee drinkers will know what I mean when I say there is a different feeling and mental/psychological experience between drinking a cup of rich, dark coffee and a cup of wonderful tea. Both are great, but if you really want coffee, the tea just does not have the same look or texture/feel in the mouth like coffee has.<br /><br />So Teeccino is a great substitute for coffee because it meets these qualities I look for. It is dark, sometimes black, in the cup. It is rich smelling, and has the body or texture in the mouth like a coffee product. Just like coffee and tea, you can drink it plain or add cream and sugar.<br /><br />This particular blend with the chocolate is wonderful. I, personally, do not add any sugar at all, but I do use a little creamer sometimes.<br /><br />I like a cup of Teecinno in the late afternoon and evening because it is herbal and has absolutely NO caffeine. I can have my coffee-like drink without the worry of being up all night long. We all know that even de-caffinated drinks still have caffeine and therefore can still cause problems for some people, but this never had caffeine so there are no problems.<br /><br />Finally, I tried other brands of a similar product, but I promise you, Teeccino is the best of all of them, and it has multiple flavors to match the specialty coffees on the market.",great

1568,B004T33F2O,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.",other

But they obtained my phone number from Amazon, called me to tell me that normally they overnight these types of items in any event, but while they would happily upgrade for Saturday Delivery at no charge to me so I would have the order for Christmas, they had worries that there was possibly no Saturday delivery in rural area (I live in Bridgehampton NY and they were correct, there is no Saturday deliver here even from Fed-X) and so, to avoid the order sitting around unrefrigerated from Friday till Tuesday, they were calling to ask if they should hold the order and instead ship Tuesday for Wednesday.<br /><br />Since I did not pick up my calls Thursday eve or Friday AM rather than just leave a voice-mail a call their job done, when I finally answered a call at 5:20 Friday, it was from a seller employee's cell phone, who had my order with him, in order to be able keep it freshest, pending an instruction from me, and so as to make absolutely sure they were following my wishes.<br /><br />As you can imagine the items received were commensurate with that service, and when they arrived Wednesday morning they were perfect IN EVERY WAY.<br /><br />And no matter how expensive the items (and they were the cheapest of their kind I found this season), this kind of service, while certainly also rare as the items themselves, is in my estimation, priceless.",great

It's hot but there is definitely hotter stuff out there. A lot of sauces seem to focus on the heat and not the flavor, but that's not really the case here. This stuff actually has a really nice flavor to it. Flavor's pretty subjective, and to be frank, I'm not sure I can effectively describe the flavor. Get one bottle, or try it out if you've got a hot sauce store or a Firehouse Subs around... It's my go to sauce if I'm looking for something that packs a punch.

1626,B004SISLQ0,I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants.

I have chewed through several packs of different Eclipse flavors and this gum just doesn't do it for me.  The pieces are kind of small so I chew two at a time and the flavor lasts all of  five seconds leaving you with just this rubbery, not very fun to chew gum in your mouth.<br /><br />The Peppermint flavor is pretty tasty at first but the flavor disappears pretty fast.  The only very, very minor advantage to this flavor of Eclipse over others is that the hint (very, very minor hint) of Peppermint stays with the gum for awhile.<br /><br />I probably will try other brands of sugarless gum.  Eclipse just doesn't do it for me.",other

It tastes pretty fresh and has a rich nutty sesame oil taste and the texture is a teeny bit thick and wonderful. I like that it is organic and it is only medium refined which hopefully makes you think less chemicals were used in the refining process. I do wish they would give you more details about the refining process, storage history, freshness and any chemicals used in their oil. I think you are partially guessing here. Unrefined sesame oil is divine and tastes a little richer and more ""meaty"" than highly refined. To me it is kind of like the difference between whole wheat bread and white bread (though not so striking). Unrefined does not seem as smooth-tasting as a refined oil, and may have more of a distinct taste in recipes, whereas the refined sesame oil is more subtle and may blend in better with your other ingredients.

With extended time a clear pineapple note comes to dominate the aroma. The pineapple and butterscotch aroma (pineapple upside down cake?) is yummy. On the tongue it is filigreed and lacy. Cerial honey, cake batter up front. There are some fruit esters at midpalate (apricot and sugar cane) and distant wood notes at the finish which is moderately short.

So many of the training treats out there are just too small or too large. These treats are the perfect size. I usually get the chicken flavor but with the extra chicken added. It comes in Lamb and Liver flavor too. When I yell to my dogs that I have a 'special treat for you' they come running, which is what I want. They even know where I keep it and poke it with their noses while they wait impatiently for me to open the bag. I make them sit before I give it to them. They love the flavor of the extra chicken treats and never turn it down. I like it because of the size and my use in training with the dogs. I usually buy them 10 bags at a time because I go through them so fast. It's one of my favorite things to reach for with the dogs.

Afterall, UK delivers to US all the time and they should have some I idea based on previous deliveries to the States.<br /><br />ARRAM Traders said they couldn't tell me anything about a delivery estimate and chose to cancel the order.

1770,B000JSOBSU,"Good vegan-friendly baked beans in a tomato-based, rather than brown sugar and molasses-based, sauce.  Nicely spiced, relatively simple baked beans, the way they were meant to be.  I haven't found a better price for them in America, than Amazon's subscription service by the case.<br /><br />They're less sweet than other kinds, such as the Heinz Vegetarian Beans usually sold in America, and have about 35% fewer calories due to having less sugar.  The can I have lists 90 calories per serving, 3 servings per can.<br /><br />Strange ""how to play with this food"" suggestion:  corrupt your basic beans by adding chunks of green pepper, onion, green olive with pimento and/or (yes, really) radish.  The sauce for these beans works well with all of the above.  I grew up, in the days before ramen, considering a small can of baked beans heated with sliced radishes mixed in, to be an excellent budget dinner.  (Hey, if they work with tacos at Mexican restaurants, WHY NOT with beans?)<br /><br />And yes, they do make a good breakfast, served over toast, perhaps with some sauteed mushroom slices.  As I'm vegan, I've had to be creative at breakfast, when all my friends are eating egg and cheese dishes.<br /><br />Important:  Don't have these in your carry-on when going through an airport gate, no matter how handy of a quick snack they seem to be, with most even being packed with a pull-top lid.  There has been no sadder sight to me than having to head to the gate with my cans of Heinz Beans sitting on top of the x-ray machine as ""confiscated goods"" because of the liquid they contain, ahead of a 20 hour trip. (!)  That said, they work well for train journeys, because they taste nearly as good cold as they do warm, and unlike other kinds of canned beans, don't need to be rinsed before eating.",great

The box lists the same spices for each box, but they are in different ratios, depending on the strenght of the backround tea. The black tea, uses ginger, then cinnamon, clove, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamon, in decreasing amounts of spice, as you decend down the spice list. (altho the company also uses spice oils, for the teas, for more flavor.) The green tea CHIA as more cinnamon in it, compaired to the black chia. NOW, for the WHITE CHIA. SPICES AS  FOLLOWS, its mostly CINNAMON, then ginger, allspice, clove, nutmeg, and cardamon. ALL real CHIA teas, use these spices, but they need to be balanced to the teas, and WHITE TEA, is very delicate tea, of course. ALso, since it is even less processed than GREEN TEA, its very easy to make it bitter.  (It has more antioxidants than green tea too.) SO, if you get this, and you want it to taste good, dont throw BOILING WATER on the tea bag(s). Let your water sit for a minute, until its around 190 degrees F. THEN, add your tea bags, and dont let it brew for more than FOUR MINUTES. THEN, like ALL CHIA TEA, it must be VERY sweet, for the spices to ""work"". I add asparteme, and LOTS of it ,and a bit of honey, and some SOY MILK....ALL DONE!!! Stash's chia tea is the best, the VERY BEST. I tasted them all. There's no black pepper, chicory, or other wierdness.  SO, even tho with white chia you only get 18 bags of tea per box, instead of 20 with the GREEN or BLACK CHIA, its worth the few extra pennies for this tea. BUT, first, do you like WHITE TEA, and DO YOU LIKE SPICES? (and if you dont like to sweeten your tea, or add milk/soy, just stay away from CHIA. ) PS. dont make this the old TIBETIAN way, cos you dont want to BOIL white tea.",great

I did some research.I found that some recommended improving the flavor with ""waking up"" the leaves by pouring a small bit of hot water on them and then draining it off and adding fresh water for steeping. I also read that Oprah likes to spice hers up with a mix of cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Wow both those tips really made all the difference for me.

My dog got through most of the ranger rib within 30 minutes. She is still chewing on some of the pieces that have splintered off.<br /><br />The only worry I have is that the splintered pieces are just that. Thin, sharp, oddly shaped pieces. Even the main bulk of the bone after having split was very sharp looking. I would suggest to monitor your dog, especially if you have one that is known to not chew their food very well, or will get in a rush in the presence of another dog and swallow pieces before being well chewed. Swallowing these sharp pieces could be very dangerous and has me monitoring my dog very closely when she chews on these ranger ribs.<br /><br />I previously bought the Merrick GI bones. The bone is much thicker and does not splinter. One bone for her has lasted her (collie/hound mix) for more than a month and she has barely cracked the bone. Other breeds, her roommate the american bulldog/lab mix makes it look easier to crack the GI bone, but she practically devours the ranger rib very quickly.<br /><br />I would consider buying the ranger ribs only on a treat basis. MAYBE once a week if at that. They get eaten up way too fast. Although they are much cheaper than the GI bones, I don't believe they are worth buying if you want a bone that will last.",other

This particular product, Dagoba Cacao powder, is the bean, not the cocoa butter.... hence, it is not chocolate.  Why would anyone in their right mind buy this non-chocolate rip off?

While the flavor of this oil is okay (not nearly as great as I would have hoped based upon some of the Melina's reviews), the excruciatingly difficult and nonsensical packaging is enough to keep me from ever buying this again. Each individual bottle is quite small and then the narrow neck is covered with some kind of wax or foil cover that has no easy means of getting in--and as the top portion is so narrow that the only way to do it was to cut into it with a sharp blade, it would have been easy to cut myself. I finally was able to cut off tiny bits of the overwrap (which seemed to be a bit sick possibly with some minor oil leakage--perhaps from one of the other bottles) after about 10 minutes only to be confronted with a teeny, tiny cork jammed well into a narrow neck of the bottle with no gripper area or way to get the cork out. I tried two different wine openers with one almost pushing the cork all the way in... I was able to salvage it but then the cork was damaged so that attempting to close the oil bottle in any fashion that would preserve the rest of the oil is now impossible. I'm going to need to decant it into something else to keep it protected.

Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house, not for the cranberry sauce (which I loathe), but for the cranberry juice she always had on hand. I loved it! And she'd mix it with a bit of ginger ale for me and oh, I felt so grown up...my first cocktail! Virgin, of course. We lost her the year I started college, so every time I taste anything with cranberry, I think of her. Then growing up, my mom taught me how to make this delicious cranberry-orange bread with fresh cranberries, and that bread is why I always have cranberries in my freezer. I made it for my in-laws the first Christmas after the wedding and now they look forward to it every year. Maybe after I've tried this straight I'll need to try it with some orange juice. But cranberry is a flavor very near and dear to my heart, so I am very much looking forward to trying this one. The health benefits of cranberries aren't such a bad thing either, and since I don't drink juice anymore, this might be a good way for me to get them.<br /><br />This blew my socks off. The scent when the package is opened is a sweet cranberry, not the tart berry I was looking for, but I can't bring myself to complain. I put about a quarter of a teaspoon in a small mug, added about 75-80 C water, some sugar, and frothed it up. Then I added robots (by which I mean ice in the shape of robots) and a touch of cold water to make a beautiful iced tea. I am so far from disappointed it hurts. This is lovely. I didn't expect to like this one nearly as much as I do, but I am in love. I'm definitely seeing the berry in cranberry, but there's also a hint of tartness in the middle of the sip. I am so surprised, I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by this. But I am and I am going to restock on it ASAP. I can't wait to try it blended with some vanilla matcha or some orange juice...yum.

1892,B000RUF8GY,"Ortho sells a number of Weed B Gon products, and it took me some searching to find exactly the one I wanted. I wanted one of the versions containing the chemical triclopyr, which is what my state agricultural university extension service recommends for killing wild violets, which for several years had been stubbornly resisting all my organic methods to keep them from taking over my lawn. Since I only had a fairly small area to spray and didn't want to invest in major league spraying equipment if I didn't have to, this version was just what I needed. It's very easy to use. You just attach it to the end of your garden hose, turn on the water (not full blast, just enough to make a nice controllable spray) and spray it on your broadleaf weeds. They absorb the triclopyr through their leaves, it messes them up bad and they die.<br /><br />There was enough in the bottle for me to spray the wild violets that hadn't died after the first application (as the directions and my extension service mentioned, you usually can't get them all the first try.) Actually, I spent twice as much money on the respirator I bought to wear when I was doing my spraying. I strongly recommend you read the directions carefully and follow the safety instructions.

Made from a spectacular Keemun ('Hong Cha') and Ceylon blend, this Twinings will put a guaranteed smile on your face that could only be removed by either having to drink coffee again, or running totally out of tea (only blackguards do THAT).<br /><br />I have touted this as my second-favorite tea, a close second only to the bible-black, rich and fertile <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000F4J74G"">Twinings Irish Breakfast Decaf Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which by the way is available in both decaf and normal). These teas cry out for a splash of cold milk or cream - but as I often say, it is no sin to drink it black as does my wife. The only sin is in NOT drinking it.<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named ""FLOW-THROUGH"") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Learn the secret of the Royal Family and all those classy people who think 'Twinings' when they think 'tea'.",great

I keep this in the pantry and sometimes mix it with the Jama flavor (hisbiscus flower flavor, and excellent!) and serve it over crushed ice. It's awesome. It's also shelf-stable.

I checked the listed ingredients on several brands before I bought the first cans to try, and decided to get three cans of each brand. Pinnacle was the only brand my babies would eat.  They just sniffed at their bowls, then walked away without eating it, which I can't blame them for, considering all the YUCK! stuff in some of them.  I ended up giving the other cans away.  My two Ragdolls go absolutely wild for their Pinnacle everyday, like it has catnip in it.  If I'm late feeding them, they follow me around the house and just beg.  They can hear the can top popping from the other end of the house, too!  It's so funny to watch them and hear the little meows.

1947,B008EG5ADY,This cereal is a fave at our house. It can be a snack or a cereal. It has a nice appealing texture which does stay crispy with milk longer than flake type or other shredded grain type products. It is sweet but not sugary. We find it very satisfying. Not sure I notice any brown sugar taste - but as noted it is sweeter than plain grain cereal.<br /><br />Oats seem like a heart healthy concept - I'm not entirely sure that the processing of said oats into this cereal makes it healthy but then we alternate it with real oatmeal so it is not a daily meal for us. It does seem to go quickly as it is easy to eat a bigger bowl than the serving so we have to watch that.<br /><br />We also (contrary to the cover) do not like this with fruit unless the fruit is slightly tart. It makes it too sweet. So for those strawberries or other berries that have a more sour than sweet taste this is ideal. For fruits like banana's or sweet blueberries it was just too much sweet for us.,great

1987,B0002X8HCS,"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",great

I'm writing to alert the seller and any potential buyers that this price, $7.99 for one packet of four chazuke servings, is ridiculously high.  Is the description wrong, and this is actually more than one packet?  Is the seller really trying to get a 300% markup over regular retail just for selling through Amazon?

TURNS OUT that she has an allergy to who knows what (not this product I'm sure) which has made her mouth sore. The vet said it is common even in young cats and suggested it could have been caused by grass or plants she may have eaten during her short little trips out into the yard.

1996,B005EF0HU4,"While I enjoyed the contents of this basket, I must admit that the current price of almost $60 seems a bit steep to me.  The basket contains quite literally ""a taste"" of some of the items as some of the items only contain two or three pieces.  For instance, there are only two chocolate covered cherries and only three hazelnut chocolates.  There is a single brewing of coffee that comes in a box that is four times the size of the actual bag of coffee contained therein.  There is a tiny box of coffee cookies that contained four very small cookies.  And there is a box of Dolcetto dark chocolate pastry cookies that contain only three tiny sticks.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />There were some items that contained what I consider to be a more ""normal"" amount.  For instance, there was a pack of Honees candies.  I liked the Honees so much that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000E7SYKM"">I bought a whole case.</a>  There was a box of garlic crackers that I thoroughly enjoyed.  There was a box of olive-oil breadsticks that, at first I thought were just okay, but it turned out that I really liked them.  I also liked the thin water wheel crackers.<br /><br />There is a rosemary herb encrusted salami that is very strong - the jury is still out on that one.<br /><br />I haven't tried the olives or the cheese spread.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the basket, but I can't help but think that it is overpriced for what you are receiving - especially with some of the items being so small.  If the basket was about $35, I would rate it higher.  For $60 you could put together your own basket of goodies that would put this to shame.",other

2002,B003EI9LSC,"Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more ""dry"" than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how ""low fat"" or ""low calorie"" they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!",other

You can use it in recipes (Tiramisu comes to mind), frappes, iced lattes, lattes or just straight as a slightly sweet espresso. This would also be a great mixer for coffee cocktails. It would be nice to keep a can or two on hand in the pantry.  I personally probably wouldn't just be grabbing a can to drink straight because that's just not my thing but for anyone who likes strong coffee flavor it would be a treat.

A very easy recipe to make that gets rave reviews in my house is to sprinkle the seasoning generously on the chops and grill in a pan. Once they are about 5 minutes from being done add 2 Tb of honey & 1 Tb of butter.  It makes a sweet, but spicy glaze on the chops.

The cookies are indeed sweet, but not overpowering and have a rich buttery flavor that I think enhances the overall mix. The cookies aren't soft, so they add a good crunch to the mix. The mix tends to settle, with lighter objects (the pretzels) landing on top and the MMs on the bottom, so be sure to mix it before grabbing a handful to be able to fully experience the perfect balance of sweet and salty.

2058,B001SAW93C,"Chicken wing sauces are easy to overthink. The purist wants nothing but Frank's Red Hot and butter (conveniently packaged, premade, by Frank's). The more adventurous may try something like a Parmesan-garlic or mango habanero. But among the mainstream wing aficionados, the only debate is how hot and what kind of heat to apply.<br />Budweiser's Hot and Spicy packs a nice amount of heat, with a vinegary tang and good pepper flavor. It's not so hot that is sears the taste buds, but it may be too hot for more delicate palates. If you like your wings spicy, but not bar-challenge-sign-a-waiver hot, this sauce should suit you well.<br />My only complaint is that the sauce is on the thin side, and doesn't cling to a naked wing all that well. I'll try it again with a breaded wing, which should solve that problem.<br />Definitely worth a try for the wing connoisseur.",other

2062,B0055Q0TF0,"I've been drinking International Coffee for 35 years now.  My elder sister drank Suisse Mocha when I went to her house, and the instant I hit adulthood, she offered me a cup. I really liked it, but later, my budget did not allow for it, so I tried making my own from a combination of cocoa mix and instant coffee.  What I got, was sick.  After that, I was done with Suisse Mocha, and considered buying other flavors my one little vice in life.<br /><br />Over the years, flavors I have liked--or not--have come and gone.  I loved the Kahlua flavor; it's been discontinued.  But every time I see a chance to load up on these hard-to-get coffees (at least where I live, in a major metropolitan city), I grab the best.  I think the Vanilla Bean Latte and the Vanilla Caramel are entirely scrumptious.  The directions give you an idea of how much to use; I judge by the size of the mug in my hand.  I don't mess with hot milk; this is all the coffee I'm drinking, and I am not awake enough to heat milk!  Hot water, just like instant coffee, and then, if I have it (so at home yes, at work no) I add a little milk and stir.<br /><br />I write this in the hope that the product will become more popular and therefore easier to find, but what may happen is that you folks out there will grab up the last few of my delicious brew.  Well, it's written now, and I guess I will publish it.<br /><br />Amazon, thanks for hooking me up with my hard-to-find coffee!",great

I've seen the same size pack go for $40 at a local shop.  The flavor is very floral with no bitterness at all unless you overbrew it.<br />The tea is fascinating to watch when it brews.  The 'pearls' will unroll into little branches, which are the tender shoots of the tea plant.  Because the tea shoots are large, there is no need for an infuser since they stay at the bottom of the cup.  In fact, the metal of the infuser can give the delicatley flavored tea a funny metallic taste.  So I don't reccommend using a metal infuser, if you are squeamish about seeing your tea leaves at the bottom of the cup, go for a nice ceramic infuser.  They make teacups with a built in ceramic strainer, one of those would be ideal for this tea.<br />One caution: it is done when it TASTES done, even if it doesn't LOOK done.  It's a very pale colored brew.  I live at 6500 feet in elevation, and I usually have to boil the water to get it to brew to the proper strength within ten minutes because of the lower boiling point.  At sea level, use almost boiling water.  The directions say brew time is 90 seconds or less, but it usually takes three to five minutes depending on how strong you like it.",great

2142,B004GWSWCQ,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:37 Mins<br /><br /></span>From a cold start, 90 sec to heat, 30 sec to brew. While already on, reheat and brew, 45 sec!!! But not compatable with reusable K-CUP??? Whats up with that??? I am considering returning this item.<br /><br />According to other reviews the OfficePro line may have a better pump compared to the Home line. Although louder and more vibration, equilavant to a loud aquarium air pump. I considered the compact B130 DeskPro, or even the other Mini editions can take up to 2-3 minutes to brew.<br /><br />Other considerations, this has a water resevior where the B130 did not, I quickly came to apreciate the benefit to having the resevior. Was disapointed unable to hook up a water line, that would have been great. The metal drip plate rattles during the pump priming setup, it is very annoying but just removing the plate and just using the bottom plastic catch below to hold the cup for brewing works well. Note another reviewer suggested using a mouse pad underneath to help with the vibration noise. Unable to reproduce rattle for the video, appears to have gotten better aftere a few days. Be sure your countertop is level.<br /><br />As earlier mentioned perhaps the biggest negative is the OfficePro line is not compatable with the reusable K-cup filters, as I prefer larger, stronger coffee and would like to use more/my own coffee grounds. Note one could run a double 6oz size to get 12oz. Another reviewer noted that the EKOBREW is compatable. So I will give that a go.<br /><br />Note it is highly recommended to use DISTILLED water to prevent scalling. It will be interesting how this unit stands up over time, currently just using filtered water.<br /><br />Oh yeah got this for $120 sold and shipped by Amazon.",other

I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of ""Greenies"" is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as ""source of vitamin k activity.""<br /><br />Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work.

By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food.

Be sure to consult with your vet on how to make the change from your current food to Precise Holistic.  It is such a change in quality, that you need to make the switch very slowly so your dog's system can adequately get used to all its goodness without digestive upset.

2331,B0024SA0M4,"I have tried three kinds of St. John's Wort tea: Yogi, Traditional Medicines, and this brand.  For hot tea, Traditional Medicines was my favorite, due to its pleasant minty flavor.  Yogi made a nice hot tea, too, with a more cinnamon and licorice flavor to it.  As a hot tea, The Republic of Tea Happy Tea wasn't my favorite.  I guess I'm just not a fan of strong fruit flavors in my hot tea.  However, as an iced tea, I thought it was quite delicious, and I'm incredibly glad I tried it that way.  St John's Wort doesn't have its full effect unless you're having quite a few glasses each day, and when it's hot out or you're very busy, it can be quite a pain to brew a new cup every few hours.  But as an iced tea, I can make a lot at once and store it in a pitcher in the fridge.  On a hot day, the lovely peach flavor is quite refreshing.  Even my boyfriend has started drinking it.  I definitely plan on buying it again, especially with summer approaching.",great

Instructions were straight forward and the end result turned out great!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />First step involved boiling the tapioca pearls.  Just make sure you have enough (if not additional water in the pot).  Because of the excess starches, these pearls need room to expand and soak.  Don't over cook.<br /><br />After drained and cooled, you make (shake) the packet ingredients.  Our favorite was strawberry, but Mango came in a close second.  Have not tried the tarrot yet (fear of the unknown).<br /><br />We even tried standard lemonade (our own making) with the bubble pearls and it was good as well.<br /><br />Don't forget to get extra straws.  You can't suck these pearls through standard sippy straws.<br /><br />Happy bubbling.",great
2333,B0031DTZRW,"Before I get into the meat and potatoes of my review, I'd like to point out that the front of the packet reads, ""Sweet & Salty.""  THERE IS NO SALT IN THIS PRODUCT.  The ingredients listed are:  Popping corn, coconut oil, sugar, beta carotene.<br /><br />Now, if you make this in your Whirley Pop according to the directions on the back of the packet, the sugar caramelizes.  Not only does the sugar caramelize, but the crank is VERY hard to turn once the sugar starts melting; this makes it very easy, indeed, to break the delicate, plastic crank on your lid.  What you ultimately end-up with is sticky, brown popcorn, and a BIG mess to clean out of your pot and off of the lid (and cleaning that lid isn't exactly what I'd call ""easy"").  My daughter, the Princess of Kettle Corn wrinkled her nose when she saw what it looked like, but being the trooper that she is, she ventured a taste...and (drum-roll, please) she declared, ""Nope.  That DOES NOT taste like kettle corn!""<br /><br />So, after tossing the whole first batch and soaking the pot for an hour to get some kernels ""unglued,"" I tried again.  I opened the side of the packet that contains the popcorn and sugar FIRST (being careful not to open the oil side) and emptied the contents into a wire mesh strainer over a bowl.  I shook the strainer so that ALL of the sugar was separated from the popcorn kernels.  I reserved the sugar and mixed a little popcorn salt with it.  THEN, I opened the oil side and put that into the Whirley Popper along with the (now sugar-free) popcorn kernels.  I popped the popcorn as I usually would.  When it was finished, and still VERY hot, I took a large bowl with a tight-fitting lid and filled the bottom with hot popcorn; I sprinkled the sugar/salt mixture over this.  Then I added more popcorn; then more sugar/salt, repeating the process until the bowl was filled to within two inches of the top.  Then I put the lid on the bowl, and tossed and turned and shook until I was fairly certain that the popcorn was adequately covered with the sugar/salt mixture.  My daughter tasted it and liked it much better.<br /><br />My family LOVES our Whirley Popper and Wabash Valley Farms popcorn, but this product (in my opinion) is a dud, and an expensive one at that.  If you want my advice, use the Real Theater Popcorn packet and sprinkle some extra-fine sugar on it in the bowl (not the popper) while it's still hot -- you won't have to clean burned sugar out of the pot (and gunk off of the lid), you'll save money and you'll have fresh, non-microwaved kettle corn.",other

I love the bargain price of prime & benefits of being a prime member.<br />I had been buying Herseys with almonds in the 6 bar / 4 package sets.  All were bought & filled from Amazon, so it seems like I am compairing ""apples to apples"" so to speak.<br />My expectations were exceeded. I was receiving them quickly & most important..... FRESH!!!<br />So I thought....  ""Hmmmm...  The other Herseys were coming fast & super fresh (expiration dates of 03-2013, a bit over a year away from right now, with tonight being 29 February 2012.)  Maybe I should graduate to the 36 count.  After all, they will last longer.""<br />So I did go for the 36 count box. The first time I have ever bought one anywhere.<br />When the box arrived tonight, I opened it & looked at the expiration date. To my horror, it is less than three months away.<br />I know it might sound crazy. They are in date. I understand that. But it makes all the difference in the world in the taste to buy & eat one with the longest time you can find to expiration.  Try it sometime.  Take one bar with a date of expiration  with about five months away, open it and take a look at it.  Usually, in my experience, bars that are five months or less from expiration tend to be easily broken, dry, crumbly, stale tasting,  The almonds are usually not tasty at all.<br />Then get a bar with nine months or more to go before expiration.  Open the wrapper.  Notice the appearance of the bar, not crumbling or dry looking, the chocolate is fresh looking & smells wonderful.  The chocolate melts in your mouth smoothly & the taste is fabulous!  The almonds are fresh & appealing.<br /> I 1000% believe you will honestly taste a difference between the two bars and most likely you will want to finish eating the fresher bar.<br />When I shop for food, the first thing I check is the date of expiration.  I have found things out of date by months & still on shelves for sale.  That is a bit disturbing to me.  It happens more often than I like.<br />This is the first item in food that I have ever bought from Amazon that I was disappointed in.<br />For the $28 + I paid, I want to savor the little candies. These I know I will not enjoy. I am sending it back, unopened.  Tomorrow.<br />Still love my Amazon.

2354,B002AQIU22,"It's very difficult to find healthy prepared foods that are low in salt.  Dr. Joel Fuhrman's line of canned food is a wonderful find for me.  I wish it was organic, so I lop off a star for that, but I haven't been able to find anything else like this out there, organic or not.  Most ""low salt"" foods are really still pretty high in salt, but Vitabeanavegamin is an exception, with only 110mg of salt in the entire can (4% of USRDA).  It takes a little while to get used to low salt foods, because we're all so used to having salt in everything (especially soup!), but it's true that if you give your taste buds a few days to adjust, you'll start to find ""normally"" salted foods way too salty, and the flavor of the truly low salt foods just pops right out.<br />Nutritionally, this soup is great.  To be honest, I don't eat it as a soup but rather as it comes out of the can, which is very dense (even denser than a stew).  The whole can is 280 calories, with a total of 110mg of salt, 1g of fat, 980% of daily requirements for vitamin A, 70% of vitamin C, and 20% each of calcium and iron.  Even better, there's 14g of fiber (58% USRDA) and 14g of protein.

They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only ""real"" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br />****",other

2401,B000CQE3O6,":: Stash White Christmas White Tea ::<br /><br />Having read that white tea is even more healthful than green, more antioxidants, and also that its flavor tends towards the light and mellow, which would be good for my ice tea mixes ... I went on a hunt in AMZN's aisle for white teas. This type seemed to be generally a bump up in price compared to the general pop, like mostlly in the $18+ range. Then found this Stash blend at only $13, so for the savings, I figured that I could overlook the part about Christmas on the packaging.<br /><br />I was also happy about the choice of blend on this. White tea, ginger root, peppermint. Ginger is absolutely my favorite flavor for ice tea already. And a little peppermint in there sounded good, too.  Now that I have it, comment on the taste of the blend. The ginger in there is only very subtle. Which is fine, as I can add extra ginger tea bags to my ice tea batches -- and probably better as is for drinking just a cup of hot, straight tea.  The peppermint is distinctive. Overall, the taste of the blend is quite crisp and light, with an easy-going flavorful tinge from the peppermint and ginger.<br /><br />When I tried this tea, I was instantly pleased, and made a note to buy Stash brand again. (AMZN is running a promo on the brand this month, so that works well...)<br /><br />I am glad to have discovered Stash, and am eager to try a few more varieties. My previous experience in brands of teas what limited by what has been available at my grocery stores. Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, Yogi, Triple Leaf. Recently via AMZN shopping I've bought and tried three brands new to me.<br /><br />  o Bentley's. High quality green tea.<br /><br />  o Stash. White tea blend - very nice!<br /><br />  o Clipper. Blend of white tea + ginger. Tastes dry and messy and old.<br /><br />Glad that Clipper wasn't my only intro to white tea, since it was such a loser. The Stash got here the same week, and it, in contrast, was a very satisfying acquisition. I'm hoping for equally good results when this month I try out Stash in another variety, like probably a Green + ginseng. Or possibly a black, or even one of the chais ...",great

However, the directions do say to ADD a can of water to this little can before heating.  But it is like drinking flavored water before you add any additional water.  I do like that there is quite a nice quantity of mushrooms included.  But....I find two main problems with this soup: it tasted like a bowl full of flavored salt and it is so loaded with Monosodium Glutamate that I woke up with a headache the next morning!!  This is what a large dose of MSG does to me so I know that they had to add lots of MSG to make this soup have any flavor at all.  I'll have to use it not as a soup but as a topping for casseroles or when baking chicken even though it is so dilute and loaded with salt and MSG.  Maybe I'll just give them to the local food bank.  The can may say it has 1875 mg of salt per small 10.5 ounce can but it tastes like it has at least twice that amount in it.....and this is a very small can of soup! That's nearly one whole day's worth of allowable salt per one small can.  And ofcourse the neurotoxicity of the MSG is soooo scary too.  No, I can not recommend this soup to anyone!

I purchased these cookies based on other reviews and I'm glad I did.  The taste, flavor and texture of these cookies is very good.  It was a bit disappointing that most of the cookies had broken, but I understand that's pretty common for GF baked goods, especially when they have to be shipped.  Nonetheless, they were good enough that none of the crumbles were wasted -- I just sprinkled them on top of vanilla ice cream and that was even better.  I most likely will order these again.

If you can, buy Fauchon or Reese's both of which are far superior and offer far more for the price asked. If, however, you have no other access then this is, as I said, adequate.

2440,B007NVH0DY,"This coffee, packed in the new VUE format for Keurig Vue machines, is absolutely a clone of coffee you can buy at (ahem) certain donut shops that are found all over the US. Which shop? Well, if you are in New England, you call those ubiquitous shops by a nickname that rhymes with ""BUNKIES.""<br /><br />The VUE cup is a #5 plastic sieve-like cup, with an insert of coffee filter, well packed with your favorite blend of coffee for the Keurig and topped with the foil seal. It pops into the Keurig Vue, and you have a choice of regular or strong on the touch screen. After you are finished brewing, you can remove the VUE cup and pull off the foil. The coffee and filter pull out as a unit (if you don't tear or puncture it) and you can recycle the #5 plastic cup if your local recycling takes them. The foil sometimes wants to tear and spill coffee all over, so if you are doing this at your office, do it over a waste paper basket. I would compost the coffee and filter, except that the foil is not compostable and not easily removable; I suppose after it cooled, I could do a very messy job of pulling away the foil and dumping the grounds into my compost bucket. Beware if you are trying to dispose of this right after you brew; it is a bit warm on the finger. I didn't burn myself, but it wasn't exactly pleasant, either.<br /><br />BACK to the coffee, how did it taste? I gave it a good lashing of evaporated milk and some sugar and by George, it tasted exactly like light (""regular"" to you New Englanders) donut shop coffee. I tried some black before I adulterated it and it was a bit woody and bitter. It's a medium roast, no burnt taste and a medium dark amber color, not the greenish-black dense color of say, a Sumatra.<br /><br />If you choose 6 oz rather than standard 80z, you get a brew that is rather like European coffee (German, to be specific.) I set it on ""6oz"" and ""strong"" and I had a cup that was very similar to Tschibo, Eduscho, Jacob Kroenung, or Dallmayr, all typical German coffees. Rather good, in fact. Not aromatic, but very smooth and stood up to a few Tbs of evaporated milk and just a touch of sugar. This is a somewhat sweet blend, so it seems to reject more than a little sugar, unless you love sugary-sweet coffee. I assume there is a good amount of Central American coffee in this blend as the Germans favor Guatemalan.<br /><br />If you have a Keurig VUE and you like donut shop coffee, this is surprisingly exact. I believe it is one of the most popular blends sold by Keurig coffee cup makers, and I can see why. It's not the coffee I prefer (my absolute fave is Papua New Guinea) but it's absolutely spot-on if that's your preferred java. I knocked off a star, not for the taste, which is absolutely as advertised, but for the cups, which are frankly a pain to accomplish the vaunted recycling and which are pretty pricey compared to the current K-cups. However, they say landfills are seeing an onslaught of those white cups, so ultimately, recycling Keurig cups is a good thing in my opinion. I just find it a bit messy to do it and worry if, in a busy office, the chance of grounds all over the counter is going to discourage the very act the cups are trying to achieve.",other

2446,B001SB28IW,"I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert.  Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores.  I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun.  We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor.  It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce.  In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like.  (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor.  Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue.  As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.",great

2480,B004ZQBCZ2,"My chihuahua/dachshund developed a horrendous skin allergy which got worse when he went outside. He scratched so much, we took him to the vet for a shot, prednisone and antibiotics. I had read about the benefits of Avoderm, and already was feeding them this dog food. I also have a miniature schnauzer. I noticed, when I didn't have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I've noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed. My mix is still of puppy age so I feed them ""All Stages no grain"" dogfood. It's not the cheapest, but the benefits make it worth it. I'm very pleased.",great

2491,B000EH4XYI,"I apologize in advance for being so enthusiastic. After you try this rice you will understand and appreciate where I am coming from. This is far and away the best rice I have ever had. This rice will totally spoil you. It is unlike any other rice you have ever had. All other rice is just rice. Come to think if it, all other rice just impersonates rice, and miserably. This the supreme king of rice. No other rice is like this rice. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. I have been eating it for years. Over ten at least. It is a bit pricy, but well worth it. It has a delicious, delicate and mild, but nutty like flavor that makes you just want to eat more. You'll feel like you don't even need anything else. Garnish it with something if you must. And you will want to eat it all the time. So prepare yourself. You can easily get carried away with this stuff. Even better, it has an absolutely wonderful, aromatic smell that is really a unique joy and will stimulate your desire eat it. In fact, you will probably want to cook it just to smell it in your kitchen after the first time. Then you will want to have your friends, neighbors and relatives over so they can experience it, smell it, taste it! I know I did. After your first experience you will become a Texmati Rice evangelist and want to tell everyone, and make it for everyone you know or at least get them some if they don't get their own so they won't experience life in such a state of depravation by not knowing RICE. I could not believe the wonderful smell of my kitchen when I cooked it. I said what is that. I have to do this again and often just for that effect. I have told many people about this rice and usually mention it at the check out counter, about how superb it is and that it is the best rice I have ever tasted. Cook up a cup or two and it makes the kitchen smell wonderful, just like it tastes. People will comment. I don't eat it all the time, but I would if I could. I wish I could buy it in twenty, fifty, or 100 pound bags. I would. I eat a pretty standard American diet. I like (long, brown and white) rice, but I don't eat rice all the time. This is an excellent product you can buy on faith. This is perfected rice made perfect. I see little way to improve rice over this. Easy to make in rice cooker or microwave or stove top pot. Just follow directions for perfect rice. This is THE rice to serve when entertaining. The organic variety is good too, almost as good, but I think the plain white had a slight edge over it. You might not notice, though, unless you compared. I like them both. I like these better then the other varieties. The brown is good but does not have the same described qualities of taste and smell. It beats any other Jasmine or Basmati rice on the market. Other Basmati's just don't stand up as tall. The flavor is not there. And why would you want to eat sticky rice unless you have no taste buds or are from Asia and grew up on the stuff, in which case I understand. If you favor very bland rice or have very delicate Asian taste buds then ok. You don't need soy sauce on this rice. In fact that would be a barbaric act for sure, but go ahead if you must. This is rice to taste for its own sake. This is THE RICE. Everything else is just rice substitute, ersatz rice, after this rice. I have found nothing that compares, even a close second on the market. Since this is a patented hybrid, I doubt I will. Get it! Try it! Enjoy! Don't wait. You won't regret it. P.S., in the Army we had a really great LRRP meal called 'Beef with Rice and Onions'. It was a freeze dried thing and very hard to come by. Mountain House I think was the contractor. It beat all C's by ten klicks. The freeze dried short white rice in it did not compare, but this is one of my favorite things to recreate with this rice. I have an incredible tri-tip recipe and this rice is just the ticket to go with it. BTW - my votes: best regular soy sauce - Kimlan by far. Tamari - San-J Low Sodium.",great

You just add a little water (or other liquids) and make it a paste when you're ready to use it. This jar is SUPER small. For the price it would have been much better to just get the powder, and be able to use it in dry rubs for meats as well as a wet mustard paste. If you have never had this product before, it tastes like a dijon with a stronger kick, almost like a chinese mustard.

Not only were they not as labeled, but they were exceedingly salty, more than chips not labeled as such.  60% reduced sodium?  Exactly how much more salt would there have been otherwise?

In a taste comparison, the Cape Cods were nowhere close to being as salty as the Boulder Canyon chips.

2603,B000NWCZXA,"Whether or not you like Nerds probably depends on when you were a child. I was not yet in high school in the early 80s and the sweet, tangy taste was a salve that help take my mind off homework, bullies and girls. After bus dropped me off at school, I'd run up the hill to the candy truck and buy a box or two. The grape and strawberry where the originals and my all time favorite. Eaten one at a time or in an overwhelming mouthful, I just loved 'em.<br /><br />Nerds were the ""Candy of the Year"" in 1985. They're thickly glazed with carnauba wax that gives them their hard crunch, and a flavored gloss. The center of each candy is composed of one or more complete, tangy sucrose crystals. If you were patient enough to let the coating dissolve in your mouth, then you could take it out and see that the crystals were clear. I was rarely so self retrained though, and would usually suck on their fun texture for a little while then just crunch away.<br /><br />The box has two openings at the top, one for each flavor. It was always a mystery which side I'd finish first, since I went back and forth between the two. I tried them again recently, and though my taste buds have evolved over the years, I found I still love them. It doubt they're very healthy, but that's not the point, is it? Candy has no point, it is just to be enjoyed! :)",great

2618,B002SB40FA,"I am a BzzAgent and recently received a coupon for a free bag of Bil-Jac Dog Food to try.  I have a VERY active 8 year old Labrador Retriever who is pretty spastic at times.  After eating Bil-Jac Large Breed Select Adult for several days, her attention span and energy levels seemed to be more evened out and her bowel movements were more compact as well.  From a human standpoint, the food didn't have that nasty dog food smell, so from that alone it seems like the quality of the ingredients was much higher than most other dog foods out there.  We did a challenge to see if our dog liked Bil-Jac better than the dog food we usually buy for her by setting out two dog bowls of food to see which one she preferred.  She sniffed both bowls and went right for the Bil-Jac.  This is significant because we put her usual food in her bowl and the Bil-Jac in the bowl that we usually give to our other dog (we have a side by side double bowl feeder).  She skipped right past her bowl (which she never does) to eat the Bil-Jac.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because it is significantly higher in price than the dog food we usually buy (we have two large Labrador Retrievers to feed), so dog food costs a small fortune for us already.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Bil-Jac.",other

This is a great tasting tea, very different flavor than just regular black tea, has real zing with the rose petals & safflower flavoring.  It's hard to explain how it tastes and some may not like it, but I got 3 bags so i won't run out.  It only takes about 1/2 tsp of this loose tea to make one nice cup.  You can put the loose tea in a round enclosed strainer & pour boiling water over it to steep, or put the loose tea straight into the tea pot & strain as you pour.  I usually mix the tea with a pinch of loose green tea.  If the flavor is too strong, you could mix with regular black tea, green tea, etc..  I really love it. Don't be put off by it's name. It's a nice foil package with paper lining inside the foil.  The only thing i'm disappointed with in these packages, that they didn't come with a resealer bendable thingy.

NOT.<br /><br />The berry nut flavor is basically average-tasting crunchy peanut butter with some tough, dried cranberries thrown in. I was hoping the ""nut"" was a walnut, pecan, or almond (or all of the above!), but it's merely an unimpressive sliver of regular old peanut. After I got done picking the hard cranberries out of my teeth, I decided I would never by this flavor of overpriced, disappointing peanut-butter again.",other

The 1440 pieces of gum lasted about 2 months for some 30 employees.<br /><br />My only piece of advice: buy this gum in the fall, winter, or early spring because the gum will soften when it ships in the hot summer sun, and will tend to stick to the wrapper when one is trying to unwrap a piece. :)<br /><br />Oh well... live and learn, I guess. :)",other

If you never have eaten bitter sweet then you would think there was no sugar only 8 grams per 1 oz bar as opposed to 13 grams in the brasilia which is very sweet.<br /><br />This is nothing like the Hershey dark chocolate more chocolate flavor and not as swee.

2648,B0009PCP7W,"Due to our cooking habits we use a lot of avocados in preparing our meals.  From Mexican food to salads and sandwiches and of course Guacamole Dip, they are an important part of our dietary intake.  The Guacamole dip is a favorite in our household and my wife has at least six different recipes she prepares it with.  We do though use and try out various prepared mixes such as this McCormick brand...which by the way, is one of our favorites. This adds variety and we do love variety! I can tell you right now that if I were grading this product on quality and eating enjoyment I would give it five stars in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am giving this particular one a one star review and if it were possible, I would give it less.  Did you read the price on this thing!  I must tell you that the first reviewer here saved me a bunch of coin and a major temper meltdown.  Thank you Dutch for pointing the price of this product out to me.  I was actually ready to hit the purchase button on this one after I had added it to my shopping cart.  Thank goodness I had second thoughts and went back and read the review.  This product, when we purchase it at or local store cost around one dollar.  This is a somewhat reasonable price.  Did you realize that these folks are selling ONE PACKAGE (ONE OZ) for a total of $6.00!  Either this seller is trying a big time rip off or there has been a major typographical error here.  In either case there is NO WAY I am going to plunk out that much money for this stuff...as good as it is!<br /><br />Anyway, the mix itself is quite good.  We use a lot of McCormick products and have yet to find one we are dissatisfied with.  But the price here is absolutely outrageous to the point of being offensive.<br /><br />End of review but as long as we are talking about saving money.....<br /><br />Did you folks know you can freeze avocados?  Yup, for dip and spreads freezing these things works perfectly.  I am not sure how things are in your part of the country, but here in our little part of the world the price of avocados goes through wild fluctuations.  I have quite often seen them selling for $1.50 apiece!  No there is no way that I am going to pay that much for one of these things.  On the other hand, we often, for one reason or another, find these things relatively dirt cheap.  I just purchased a whole bunch of the things for .32 cents apiece.<br /><br />When we find these on sale like this be buy a great number of them.  We take them home, let them ripen to our taste, wash and dry them and then stick them in freezer bags...usually three our four or our family.  When we want to whip up a batch of dip or spread, we simply take them out of the freeze, let them thaw and we are in business.  After they have been frozen the skins simply slip right off and you can mush them up quite easily.  This dose not work if you like sliced avocados for salads or sandwiches as they are too soft and mushy. On the other hand, it makes great dip and spread.  We cannot tell the difference in the flavor of the frozen ones over the fresh.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks",other

I HAD to make a bowl right then and there!<br /><br />For this first preparation I sifted a teaspoon of matcha powder into my bowl - I highly recommend doing this! Without it, you risk the chance of having clumpy matcha, and no one wants that! I wisked in two ounces of warmed water with my electric frother until the matcha was fully dissolved. Filled the bowl with the rest of the warmed water, about 6 ounces worth.<br /><br />I found the caramel missing an element - maybe it's sweetness, which is something I usually associate with caramel. While Red Leaf Tea doesn't add any sugar to their matchas, I found this benefited from some added sweetener.<br /><br />I also think I might prefer the Caramel Matcha prepared as a sweeter latte - either hot or cold.<br /><br />I do look forward to playing around with the Caramel Matcha more - mixing it with other flavored matchas from this company.

2670,B003HGKO78,"After living in Okinawa for nearly 4 years, returning to the US was a bit of culture shock.  We had access to American grocery stores while there, but always bought our rice, fish and produce at the local markets.  I never saw this particular variety there, but I found it at a local grocery in Virginia and tried it.  The taste is far superior to plain old white varieties from the rice and grain aisle in the regular markets, which is not good enough for me anymore.  Even short grain rice, which is hard to find at the best of times, still lacks something.  Koshihikari has superior taste and texture to even medium grain rice that might bear the label 'sushi rice'.<br />Be sure to rinse several times till the water runs clear.  I cook mine in my Japanese rice cooker b/c I cannot trust myself to watch a pot on the stove.  Though my neighbors always told me, for authentic taste, cook it the old fashioned way: rinse well, soak for 15 minutes in measured water, then cook it in a cast iron pot on the stove top.

It contains<br />maltodextrin -- as do the packets.....BUT NO DEXTROSE!  Dextrose, and sucralose, (the main ingredient), are both SUGARS...but Sucralose, of course, is sugar with a hydrogen atom changed for a carbon atom, (or some such thing)....and so a new, safer ""sugar"" results!  No ""cloying"" taste, when used to excess, as ""real"" sugar has.  So, sucraLOSE, though a sugar, is a sugar of ""a different sort""...a safer sort, for diabetics and pre-diabetics.  Granular Splenda has ONLY Sucralose and Maltodextrin...whilst the PACKET variety ADDS the Dextrose....Another form of sugar which is NOT as safe, (for diabetics and pre-diabetics), as sucralose is!  (If you don't believe me that a different formula is in each variety, read the labels, as I did!)<br /><br />This said, I have heard my sister say that there is research that sucralose COULD lead to a shortening of ""t"" cells in the body...the cells that grow shorter, anyway, as we age.  So, imbibing sucralose -- in any form -- could shorten life...according to what my sister has heard and said, anyway.  How much it shortens life -- if at all -- is something I don't know.  What I DO know is that diabetes -- in any form -- can definitely shorten life, if not treated properly!  I'm a pre-diabetic -- who actually got Type II -- then lost it, (because I lost 30 pounds!)  This may not work for everyone...but it did work for me, so I pass the info on.  A quite thin friend of mine has Type II.  She also has a very negative attitude towards life.  Losing weight obviously will not help her.  Having a more optimistic, (yet still realistic) attitude will.  But it's hard to convince nt negatively-minded friend of this.  Hopefully, this advice of trying to be more positive -- and also losing weight, if possible -- can help others.  Nope -- life isn't perfect for anyone.  But if you sit down, and list the 10 best things in your life in one column, and the 10 worst things in another, you'll see how things balance out, and hopefully, get a more realistically-positive view on life!  Hopefully, too, this realistically-positive attitude -- combined with excercise and diet -- can help regulate...or, perhaps, eventually eliminate, any person's case of diabetes.  Certainly, excercise, good thoughts, losing weight, and correct diets, can't hurt.  Even using Splenda Granulated can't hurt -- too much -- if one cuts down, just a bit.<br /><br />All in all, Splenda Granuated is a great product, and I'm SO glad to see it is now in the ""super-economy"" size.  When I looked at the ""5-pound equivalent bag"", I noticed Amazon isn't sellong that any more.  But a notice that the larger-size bag IS being sold on Amazon, should be mentioned there!  Splenda Granulated, even if does break down T-cells (quickly or slowly...I don't know), is still a great product!  Use in moderation -- or as moderately as you can -- though!",great

The fiber is equivalent to 32 calories, which are not digestible by the body and can effectively be subtracted from the 176 calories for carbs, bringing it down to 144 calories. It has 6 g protein (32 calories). That comes to a total calorie count of 194, which is very close to the 190 calories listed. The minimal difference is because carbs and protein are slightly less than 4 calories per gram, and fat is slightly less than 9 calories per gram.<br /><br />This cereal is described by the manufacturer as ""whole grain oat clusters,"" and given that the recipe for making them is different than Kellogg's Raisin Bran, it is not surprising that they don't taste the same as that product. However, in their own right they taste quite good.<br /><br />This product is not sugar-free, but it uses natural sweeteners which are slightly less unhealthy than the white sugar, brown sugar or high fructose corn syrup that KRB uses. These natural sweeteners consist of milled cane sugar, barley malt syrup, and honey. The milled cane sugar and barley malt syrup are vegan, by the way, but honey is not considered to be vegan, so it is too bad the manufacturer added it to this cereal, or they could have had another selling point. In terms of health, though, the truth is, all sweeteners which are either fructose or sucrose, which each of the sweeteners mentioned above are, raise blood glucose levels. The advantage for controlling blood-glucose spikes that this cereal offers over and beyond what KRB provides is more fiber, more protein and a little bit more fat, all of which act like anchors on blood glucose levels, lessening spikes of blood glucose due to the relatively large percentage of carbs that any breakfast cereal contains, no matter who makes it.<br /><br />A true advantage of this cereal over KRB is that it contains no artificial coloring, flavoring or preservatives. (Note that the KRB ingredient list does not admit to any coloring agents or preservatives, which I find very odd and very likely a dishonest omission--it's simply not possible that it has no preservatives in it of any kind to maintain freshness. Here are all the ingredients listed on the KRB box and on the Kellogg's website: ""Whole grain wheat, raisins, wheat bran, sugar, brown sugar syrup, contains 2% or less of salt, malt flavor."")<br /><br />What this cereal has used to color, flavor and preserve its cereal are an impressive list of very healthy substances. Mixed tocopherols maintain freshness. This is the form of vitamin E that is best absorbed in the body. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that fights cancer and heart disease. Annatto and turmeric are used to color the cereal. Annatto is rich in antioxidants that function similarly to vitamin E, and turmeric is particularly well known for its anti-inflammatory properties. This cereal also contains cardamom seed, fennel seed, and fenugreek seed, all of which are strong aids to digestion. Studies on the action of fenugreek have also found it is helpful in controlling cholesterol and blood-sugar levels. Nutmeg has antibacterial action, in particular combating the bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, nutmeg contains compounds protective of the heart and that help prevent Alzheimer's. It also tastes great and, much like cinnamon, when used in baked goods or cereals, can cause them to taste sweeter so that less sugar is needed.<br /><br />There is no mention of this product being organic, though the company makes this sales pitch: ""By effectively combining the finest all natural ingredients, sustainable practices and regular giving to worthy causes, Peace Cereal truly delivers Peace of Mind in Every Bite!""<br /><br />All in all, as high-carb cereals go, this one is a good bet. It is not safe for people with wheat or soy allergies, though, and diabetics would be better off eating a cereal with no sweetener of any kind and using a natural sweetener with no calories that does not raise the blood sugar like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000Z9ASSK"">stevia powder</a>.",other

You will not be sorry, do it, you will love it.<br /><br />My only downside here is that there are not too many blueberries, but enough. The blueberries are dehydrated, so they will not be as good as fresh (but you don't get the thermal bomb effect when you eat them). To make the most of the berries I recommend you let the mix sit for 10 minutes after you mix it for proper hydration. You will probably want to serve thse with fresh berries for the best experience.

2709,B001E5E36C,"I received the green pouches as illustrated, and the price for a full pound of tea was very attractive. The Amazon listing currently (Sept. 2011) describes this Assam tea as organic. Nothing on the package indicates this is so. However, the company's website states that this and nearly all of their teas are USDA Certified Organic.<br /><br />I have been drinking tea for some decades, and keeping notes to remind myself of favorites. I expect a quality Assam tea to have an appealing aroma and a complex flavor with hints of malt. This product failed to deliver. This Two Leaves & A Bud product is flat and uninteresting. It has little aroma and has little taste at all. The package I received was probably old inventory, long past its peak. Older tea does not go rancid; packaged tea simply looses its aroma and flavor as it ages.<br /><br />This Assam tea had mostly whole leaves, not the smaller fannings or dust-like particles you sometimes find in bargain-basement teas. You can add boiling water and infuse up to 3.5 or 4 minutes without causing excessive bitterness, but you get very little of the classic Assam flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: Bland, with little flavor or aroma. I might buy another tea from this brand, but only if I knew that it was fresh inventory ... and that it had received good reviews.<br /><br />Options: As an alternative for bargain hunters, Ahmad brand Kalami Assam tea can be purchased for about $10/pound in South Asian and Middle Eastern grocery stores. This inexpensive Ahmad tea is not great, but it is more appealing than this tea. Of the more upscale packaged brands, I recommend the Assam offerings from Peet's, especially their Assam Extra Fancy.

Poor business acumen is exhibited when a company can't be truthful in its' business dealings with customers.  Forget this one and save your money.

Equal is my second choice because it's not quite as sweet as Sweet And Low. On the other hand, if you prefer a non-sugar sweetener that's not too sweet or potent, then Equal would be a good choice for you.<br /><br />Equal is a powdery white substance. Just open the individual packet or packets and pour it in to your beverage. It is probably quite good for certain recipes as well. Keep the individual packets in the box they come in or you can put them into any container you wish.<br /><br />Just one warning: This product contains phenylalanine. If you are allergic to that or if phenylalanine makes you ill in any way I would definitely avoid this product.<br /><br />Overall, Equal is a good choice for a sweetener substitute for sugar. It isn't quite as potent as Sweet And Low; that can be a good or bad thing depending on how sweet you like your beverages or recipes. I myself prefer the taste of Sweet And Low. Of course, you can always add a little more Equal to make the drink a bit sweeter.<br /><br />Four stars.",other

If I were to order food, sight unseen ... peanut brittle in fact, it seems reasonable to order form a company called THE PEANUT COMPANY of Virginia.<br /><br />Well - The items arrives well wrapped and protected from Amazon with no visible damage to the outside of the box. The contents however were a different story.<br /><br />Which is kind of the disappointment here. The brittle arrived in such small pieces that a lot of it being simply brittle dust. On what pieces were not completely incinerated you were lucky to have maybe 1-2 actual peanuts, These were caramelized and stale like the rest of the product reminiscent of something your grandmother put out  when surprised by an unexpected distant relative.<br /><br />Now it is possible - that The Peanut Company of Virginias has one employee who suffers from an extreme peanut allergy as to only be able to toss in 11 peanuts into the brittle mix before having to run for their inhaler and in running coincidentally tripped and crushed the box of brittle... and in his dismay, hid the box for 4 years in shame before it was accidentally found and used to fulfill my order.

This product (both the cherries and the blueberries) marked the very first instance where I  bought a dried fruit product online, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />The cherries are all evenly ripe, tart, plump, deeply flavorful, and only lightly sweetened.

I've also minced them into sauces, stir fry, and salads, muddled them into lemonade (imparting a pink color and a fruity note), and I also plan to use a few of them to add a subtle nuance to an upcoming homemade mead and a cherry-infused liqueur.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this product, and given that I own a vaccum sealer and plenty of glass jars with universal lids, they should have an excellent shelf life.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",great

However, I have to say, that this Ferrero Collection ranks somewhere near the top of all of the many chocolates I have eaten; yes, it's that good.<br /><br />There are 24 chocolates in the container made up of 8 chocolates of each of the 3 different varieties.  The first kind is the Rocher, which is a chocolate wafer covering some delicious chocolate cream filling which is then covering a hazelnut.  This is my least favorite (mostly because of the fact that I'm not a huge fan of hazelnuts), but it is still very tasty indeed.  The second variety included in this collection is the Garden, which happens to be the favorite of my family and me!  It is another wafer topped with coconut flakes; this wafer then covers a divine coconut filling that is supposed to cover an almond, but to be honest, I never tasted the almond.  The final chocolate that composes the collection is the Rondnoir, a chocolate wafer covering a chocolate cream filling which is covering a dark chocolate ""pearl"" or ball.  This will be the favorite of those who love just pure chocolate delight, although everyone else will probably devour it, too.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with this collection!  It is amazingly delectable and is a fantastic gift for any chocolate lover.  I recommend it for parties, gifts, or really for anything where people will be eating.

2828,B001IZHU54,"I needed some breath mints, and when I saw the ""3 Hour Mint"" words on the box I picked it up. The ""Clinically proven to reduce intrinsic bad breath for up to three hours"" sold me. I gave them a try, and must say that I was sold! The mints have a nice taste - strong spearmint that was not overpowering. Plus, it has a nice minty aftertaste that lingered in my mouth, and (I am reliably informed) kept my breath sweet.<br /><br />Now, just because these mints are ""sugar free"" that doesn't mean that they are zero calories. In fact, each one has five calories (carbs 2g.), which is not bad for a large mint (the size of a Life Savers candy, as apposed to these tiny, tiny mints).<br /><br />I really like these mints, and will definitely be buying more!",great

I found its potency to be very weak. To get the sweetness I like, I have to use about 4 times the amount of my favorite stevia, and then the aftertaste becomes too bitter. The stevia extract that I really like begins with a K. It may seem pricey, but you will need MUCH less and it will have a much better aftertaste.

With my wife as a Celiac it has required diligent searching for good options.  On a recent trip to Utah we picked up several New Grains GF breads and found them the best GF breads we have ever had.  I decided to pick up some of this flour and use it to see how baking some of our favorite recipes would turn out.<br /><br />The flour works well as a GF substitute for regular baking flour.  I've used it in many recipes and have been happy with the results.  As is typical for GF cooking, there's a little less of a rise in the cooking process.  I'll upload a picture from a recent Pineapple Upside down cake we cooked in a 12"" Dutch oven that turned out really great as a GF desert.<br /><br />5 stars, we love having a GF flour to cook and bake with.",great

2839,B0019Z463M,"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",great

2845,B005D4NN6Q,"I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with ""filler"" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.",other

He used to love the Bench & Fields Cat Treats until they changed the formula about three or so years back and he won't touch them.<br /><br />I stumbled upon these Bonita Tuna Flakes while browsing Amazon and saw great comments and bought a small pouch to give it a try.

2896,B00473OMXC,"We decided to purchase Weber N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning because we figured if it boasted the New Orleans name, it had to be good stuff.  But, we were slightly let down by the overall spiciness of this seasoning.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I just used a little on the fish I made.  This was because in the past, some Cajun flavored foods were very spicy, and when I smelled the spice after opening it, it smelled strong.  But as we ate the fish, we could barley taste the Cajun!<br /><br />This spice is good for those who don't want an overpowering or highly spicy Cajun flavoring.  Sometimes I myself like that, but if I'm using Cajun, I usually want it to be bold.<br /><br />Add a little extra paprika alongside this seasoning and it greatly enhances it.<br /><br />Overall it isn't terrible, but it isn't as bold as one might expect from a N'Orleans Cajun.",other

2973,B001EPQ6VM,I was hunting for Gen Mai Cha when I stumbled upon another tea made buy the same manufacturer. I never had Hoji tea before. I knew from reviews of it that it was a golden colored tea. That it is. It was a blend of some odd stuff to me but that is the nature of tea blends. Hoji tea has a very unique flavor I never had before. Now the Genmai Cha made by SA is off the hook. This tea likewise is an excellent compliment for some meals. I would find it a prefect counterbalance to Teriyaki dishes. I would even drink this while eating tempura. It has a strange smoky woody taste. It is not bitter at all either like conventional tea can be. Some people say it has a seaweed like smell to it but this brand has a smell that reminds me of a field that has been burned and tilled for the next season's planting. It is not a smokey smell per say but a earthy smell. There is no chlorophyll like tinge of a cut grass field to this tea. This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I can say for myself this is another very high quality product.

Most dried herbs from the grocery store and even our local health food, organic store where you can buy in bulk,  have an off flavor that only faintly resembles the fresh.  This, on the other hand, is just superb.  It has a lovely fragrance and gives an incredible fresh thyme flavor to soups and other foods.<br /><br />I am going to spend the money and start buying Morton and Bassett herbs and spices.  I already love their peppercorns and now the thyme is just exceptional.  I have to try more of them.<br /><br />Buy this.  You will not be sorry.",great

We give our pans a light coating for frying eggs and other things and we lightly spray salads with it. It's about the same as using regular Pam, except that the sprayed ingredient is Extra Virgin Olive Oil. We're very satisfied with this product and it's very convenient.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",great

The food is designed to encourage chewing so they don't eat so fast (common Siamese problem).  It helped significantly with the vomiting, but even with feeding him the ""overweight"" amount per day, he was still not losing any weight (he weighted 17.5 lbs at his weight in and has a bit of a waddle).  We have now switched him to the Royal Canin Light 40 and he is doing well.  He seems to have a little more energy than normal and loves the food. I was concerned that the smaller pieces would cause the vomiting to reappear, but he hasn't had one problem yet.  Overall the Royal Canin brand is great and I would recommend it to anyone.",great

Each package contains three flat sticks (sort of like oversized sticks of gum). An entire package is about 270 calories; however, it's possible to eat just a portion and put the rest into a plastic bag for later. The sesame seeds are calorie-dense foods and the molasses adds some iron to the nutrition mix. These keep pretty well and are good for travel, hiking, or just taking to work. The downside is that the bars do break easily so they tend to get messy. On one hand, that's good if you just want to eat a small piece; on the other hand, you probably won't receive too many unbroken ones in the box.",other

Also, these are ideal for low-sodium diets and those who try to limit sodium intake.<br /><br />Four stars because, as another reviewer noted, the cubes don't dissolve as easily as other bouillon.

Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.

Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.<br /><br />But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water/coffee/tea/coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.<br /><br />I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites/blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.<br /><br />I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded-with-produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia-repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.<br /><br />Well, blow me down with a carbonated breath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.<br /><br />I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.<br /><br />So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six-pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.<br /><br />And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup.

After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.

They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.<br /><br />Ritz crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. Just put a bit of cheese (or melted cheese and ham) on them and you're serving up great appetizers or snack in no time! They go great with a little bit of butter on them, too.<br /><br />Overall, Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime.

Limiting myself to 2,000 calories per day does not leave much room for peanut butter, or rather, sitting down in the living room in front of the television with a sleeve of crackers and my beloved jar of Jiff peanut butter and a butter knife.  Those days have long been over.  However, I still have the urges and I miss peanut butter badly.  I stumbled across PB2 when I was doing some research on a machine called Yonanas, a machine that turns frozen bananas into a creamy tasty soft serve.  I noticed in the machine reviews that some people were mixing chocolate PB2 with frozen bananas in their Yonanas machine.  I had to give this a try!  I ordered a regular PB2 and a chocolate PB2.  I must say that this stuff really really does taste wonderful considering its low calorie count.  I really love PB2.  It is giving me back something I have missed dearly.  The powder is very fine, but mixes pretty well and pretty quick.  I always start with a little less water than the directions say and work up to a little more if needed.

3187,B004Y6PXAS,"The actual quality of QBubbles boba tea mix is pretty good.  You just mix with water, add the tapioca pearls and ice if you want, and end up with a flavorful drink.  Be warned that the main ingredients in QBubble's boba mixes are sugar, tea mix, powdered dairy creamer (which probably means trans fats), and flavoring (whatever that may entail)- overall not the ingredients that indicate a healthy drink.<br /><br />The Lavender flavor itself is interesting. To me, it tastes similar, but not the same, as Earl Gray tea with cream.  If you don't like Earl Gray, I would suggest avoiding Lavendaer Boba tea.",other

That bothers me so I rate this brand of dog cookies only 2 stars.  I have purchase most of the major dog cookie brands as I am pretty particular about what I feed my dogs. This cookie is over priced for what is in it and how small they are. There is no steak or meat used for flavoring only beef broth and grains, which is fine but the price for a small bag compared to other brands that use ground meats for flavoring is out of line. The ingredient list was missing online so I took the chance they might live up to the Steak Frites name and price. They smell good and do have wholesome grains and no fillers but so do many other brands that give you more for your dollar.

It's not the best pre-made ghee I've ever had, but it was the least expensive option on amazon.com when I bought it, and it's perfectly fine for everyday use.  I mean, ghee is just clarified butter; it's hard to screw that up and make a really bad one!  In my opinion, this one has a particularly strong flavor, which is a plus since you need less of it, and that also makes it a good mixer for combining with other oils such as olive oil (half and half ghee and olive oil makes a good sauteing oil for vegetables).  Use a little of this and maybe some other oil to saute potatoes or a variety of things and get a great and different flavor.  You probably won't need to add any additional butter either.  Also, if you want to make your grains like rice extra-tasty, saute the dry, uncooked grains a bit first in ghee, before adding the water to finish cooking them.

3288,B002LEKLJ8,"A few days ago I was posting some rather disparaging comments about Grace Hot Sauce. This sauce<br />however, blows its baby brother away with a raw, firey Scotch Bonnet flavor. This is about as basic<br />as you can get, though it does seem to straddle the line a bit between hot sauce and condiment. When<br />the sweet Jamaican smoke is cleared, however, this is a great hot sauce that's made to be enjoyed.<br /><br />Scotch Bonnets are relatives of habaneros, but if habaneros are the serious, hard working pepper plugged<br />into so many independent American hot sauces, Scotch Bonnets are their laid-back island cousin, just as<br />hot but more relaxed and sweeter leaning more towards spice and flavor. Scotch Bonnets would rather look<br />silly and taste tropical than merely kill you with heat. This sauce, a colorful yellow, is Grace's best<br />condiment by a long shot. The simple mashing of Scotch Bonnets, with some slight flavor accentuators<br />really captures the heat of the islands and flavor of a solid hot sauce.<br /><br />In the description on their website, Grace promises a challenge. ""Add a drop or two to food for a truely<br />serious pepper experience,"" though heat freaks may need to up this number by a few shakes of the bottle.<br />This sauce does have a minor tropical blast which won't floor you at once, but provides a long lingering<br />burn cycle that will continue as long as you keep eating the sauce....and you will. However, still be able<br />to taste your food and thats a plus in a world of dangerous, murderous sauces lurking around every corner.<br />It's hot enough to hang with some of the bad boys, but the flavor outshines the heat in the end.<br /><br />Sweet, rich, hot, and delicious, this sauce will absolutely not disappoint. The double-punch of cane vinegar<br />and cane sugar/citric acid give the sauce fruity tropical hints and a tangy, acidic flavor. The sauce becomes<br />tricky when you factor in the fact that it contains modified starch and ascorbic acid. These ingredients thicken<br />the sauce, gelling it a bit so that it seems like crushed peppers in a sauce the consistency of a heavier BBQ<br />sauce. This is not a bad thing at all, but be prepared to feel like you're eating a hot sauce masquerading as a<br />thick condiment. Flavor is spot on, but consistency is a bit unnatural for a traditional hot sauce.<br /><br />I love this sauce on cold pizza and pizza crust and smoked turkey sandwiches, just to name a few. However,<br />because it has such a bright, sunshine taste, I think it can accentuate other Caribbean dishes which tend to<br />use jerk spice (also made from Scotch Bonnets). If you have a sandwich with sweeter ingredients, this sauce is<br />for you. Also a great tag team partner for mango or pineapple salsas. 5 Scovies!",great

3304,B002YLCORA,"This cereal has a delicious whole-grain flavor and makes for a great healthier cream-of-wheat option, as it's made up of 100% whole-grain coarsely-ground wheat and brown rice, plus additional wheat bran.  This shows in the nutritional info as well, as 1/3 cup (33g) has 7g fiber (28% daily value) in only 23g total carbs (9% daily value) and 5g protein as well.<br /><br />Here's how I make it for a quick and hearty hot breakfast:  I take roughly a heaping 1/3 cup of it, a small handful (~1 tbsp) of some dried fruit (i.e., raisins or the like), a pinch of salt, a tiny bit of sweetener (honey, agave, real maple syrup, etc.), and a cup of any type of milk (my favorite for this purpose being my homemade almond milk) and nuke it for 3 minutes.  It comes out a bit loose but after sitting for another few minutes, it thickens up considerably and is also now cool enough to actually eat.<br /><br />Typically what I'll do is prepare the above in the bowl I'll be eating it out of (which takes all of around a minute to put together total), put it in the microwave to cook and go about continuing with my morning routine.

3310,B001KNC9VO,"Yummeh. Blueberries are not my favorite fruit, but when I opened my package I knew I was going to love this just as much as the mango. The scent was strong blueberry! It reminded me of fruit leather, deep purple, chewy, yummy homemade fruit leather by the hippie auntie I used to have. Ah sense memory, I love it so.<br />So I whisked up this delight with the plan to make a couple little lattes - one with soymilk, one with almond and one with regular. I don't know, I just wanted to taste the nuances and find my favorite pairing I guess! Also to see which milk went best with fruit flavoured matcha.<br /><br />Honestly though, I really enjoyed this one sans milk - just with some sugar. (I also experimented with sweetener, and found I prefer sugar over agave for my matcha).<br /><br />The froth! I got a crazy amount of froth with no clumps in this batch. I definitely credit the quality of the matcha for that, because my whisk skills are shoddy at best. That's when I knew I was in for a treat today. This blueberry matcha in particular was very smooth. The berry taste fluctuated from sip to sip - one sip it was a tart not quite ripe berry, the second it was an overly plump, huge juicy ripe berry. The aftertaste was definitely the latter. The flavouring felt more strong in this batch than I expected, but I loved that very much. What a deal :D Again, I love that this company uses natural flavouring - it really shows in the quality of this matcha that it tastes like the berries, not like a candy.<br />With almond milk, the matcha latte tastes almost like a baked good - a blueberry matcha scone or shortbread. The soymilk tasted, well, like soymilk (I think it was my least favorite of the 3). With hot frothed 2% milk it was very sweet. I find hot milk to be naturally sweet, so that probably accounts for it!<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, I had it as an iced latte. (If you're wondering, with all this crazy matcha energy - I'm learning the ukulele!) I HIGHLY recommend enjoying these fruit flavour matchas from Red Leaf Tea as iced lattes. Oh my goodness! The fruit flavour just comes alive and honestly tasted like a blended real fruit smoothie. Of course, once I get a blended I will be making blended iced drinks 100% - but until then, the ice cubes will suffice.",other

Also, there is no way the rice noodles can break unless someone perhaps sat on the packaging. Having tried this just by itself there is NOT a whole lot of flavor going on, spicy flavor especially. There is at most a strong peanut flavor. I squirted a ton of Sriracha Hot Sauce on this and that helped a ton in the flavor department. Next time I'm going to make a stir fry with them which will just add more flavor and fill me up even more! Suprisingly, despite the lacking flavor, this is quite filling given the portion size. I don't know how much they cost in a grocery store because I've never saw them even while I worked in a grocery store for almost three years, but I say its worth it if you want to throw a curve ball in your home meals.",other

The cheddar and pretzel flavor is well-balanced and the texture falls somewhere between a pretzel and a cracker.

These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000F4F95C"">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS"">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.",great

There is only a shaker option, and luckily, it doesn't come flying out.<br /><br />I still cannot get over how much more flavor and spiciness this Badia Cayenne Pepper has versus other ones we've tried.  It has flavor, not just spice.  I don't want any other kind anymore after having used this.  Superior quality product.

The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky.

3364,B0012OV5VG,"We've been enjoying McCormick's crock-pot chilli for some time now so I thought why not try this newest recipe. Of course it's simple: chicken ( I use thighs with skin removed ), a couple cans of stewed tomatoes ( plain is good, Italian better ), can of tomato paste and a half pound of sliced mushrooms. That's it. I put these ingredients in my slow cooker around noon time. A while later ( 4-5 hours on high or 8 hours on low per the instructions ) it's ready. It can be eaten as is or, as we do, put on top of spaghetti. Sometimes to make it even more like spaghetti sauce I'll add a can of marinara ( Hunt's works well ) which is just the right touch and stretches the sauce base.<br /><br />  This dish isn't what you'd call 'gourmet' but when time is an issue using this mix will definitely make life easier. The only down side to using thighs I find is pulling out the bones and other things not wanted. But thighs are inexpensive and tasty. I've also used chicken breast sliced into long strips which is better if you have young ones who just want to dive in and can't watch for those unwanted items.<br /><br />  Along with the chilli mix and the beef stew mix ( both get eaten very quickly around here ) the Italian Herb mix is a good kitchen tool to have when a wholesome, quick meal is called for.

3397,B000NY8ODS,"This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",great

I've varied my purchases so that I can enjoy different blends and coffees from different continents, coffees that fulfill my morning quest for the perfect cup.

Before I got started making flavored seltzer, I researched flavorings and the Bakto products seemed the best: they are natural extracts that contain no sugar or artificial sweetener. To try these products and figure out if this was a good way to flavor seltzer water, I started by purchasing the Vanilla & Citrus collection which comes with Vanilla, Bergamot, Coriander (the seed of the cilantro plant, a common cooking spice), Lemon, Lime and Orange. Lemon coriander makes an excellent seltzer flavor, btw.<br /><br />All are high quality extracts, and the only one that is of no use for flavoring seltzer is the bergamot, which is an oil extract rather than a water-soluble alcohol extract. That was kind of a disappointment, because I love bergamot flavor, but I grow bergamot in my garden, so I can just stick a fresh sprig into my seltzer if I really want to!

You can almost taste the soil the coffee was grown in before you taste the coffee itself--if you like an earthy taste with a hint of road-trip rest stop, this is the coffee for you. The most disappointing thing about this coffee is the amount of sugar needed to sweeten it. I need three times the amount of sweetener for it to taste like I added something. (I used the same measurements that I use every morning: a 10 ounce mug plus one teaspoon of sweetener but with VCB I need 3 teaspoons to taste the sweetener and I could add more but I can't bring myself to dump much more into the cup.)

For Xylitol, I prefer Xyloburst Berry mints that take longer to dissolve, or you can chew them if you like.<br /><br />It's like this - when I first got these, I over-ate them. The dentist says to consume 6-10 mg of Xylitol per day for your teeth. Each piece of these candies contains .4 mg, and 1 tin has 100 pieces, or 40 mg. Too much Xylitol isn't dangerous, but it can cause uncomfortable bowel changes, which is what happened to me. So now I'm more cautious about it.<br /><br />My strategy now, is to have some candies that are easy to consume (like these) to get my 6-10 mg a day of Xylitol, as well as some other very yummy ones that have low Xylitol for the amount of time it takes to consume them, like Dr. John's lozenge shape hard candies or Sparx. I've got a candy bowl set out that starts out with a dozen .5 mg Xyloburst berry mints in it, that I either eat or substitute for other candies during the day, to keep track of the Xylitol, and I haven't had any more problems with eating too much of it this way.

The coffees that the set came with are also very good, though perhaps not as good as say Mehmet Effendi (which is what I've subsequently taken to drinking).

3469,B000EDK5MG,"I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says ""keeps best refrigerated or frozen,"" and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.",other

A couple months down the road our male cat started peeing in different places and wouldn't go in the litter box. We took him to the vet to find out he had a severe UTI and that this had been going on for 2-3 months. We traced it back to about the time we started feeding him this Nutro Indoor Cat formula.

The texture of the gum also seems softer than most of the other Orbit flavors, making it even more appetizing. This is truly a world-class gum and it's good for your teeth as well.

The amount of sugar is  relatively small -- 7 grams. The ingredients are wholesome and natural.  Here they are:  Toasted whole wheat berry flake (whole wheat kernels, salt, barley malt), flaxseed, evaporated cane juice, freeze-dried strawberries, natural strawberry flavor.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars?  It's the flavor and fat.  A 3/4 cup serving has 240 calories, 5 grams of fat.  There just is not enough flavor to justify those numbers.

3530,B004XTCGR4,"This product is the straw that broke the camel's back, making me 100% convinced I should not eat anything made in India.  Of course, it helps I have a long history of frequenting Indian groceries for staples such as frozen naan and papadam...and it doesn't help that I frequently find half-exploded cans of botulism-encrusted, expired, imported Indian goo in any random neighborhood Indian grocery.<br /><br />So here's my report on first opening the package:<br /><br />The jaggery looks like unreasonably yellow tofu cube looking sugar blocks; they are not the lovely and natural blond or brunette of colombian panela or mexican piconcillo.  The smell is horrible, something like the plastic on a bad capacitor that has burned out, the smell of a soldering iron, something strangely industrial and/or metallic and/or plastic and/or burning.  Brake dust.  Computer on fire.  Pthalates burning in a trash heap.  Scumdog millionaire sets the pool toy factory aflame next door to the sugar fields.<br /><br />...This is food???<br /><br />Ok, I thought, maybe it's the packaging that I'm smelling, so I drop them in some water to bring to a boil.<br /><br />First thing happens, yellow color starts emanating from the cubes.  ""Oh"", I think to myself, ""It's been hit with yellow #5, or at best, Turmeric"".<br /><br />Next I notice the jaggery starts to bubble.  Bubble?  My mexican piconcillo doesn't do that.  It's just sugar, right?<br /><br />Finally, as it dissolves, I waft the scent of brake dust, caramel, something strange like a fake beef or meat flavor, something strangely umami but muskier.<br /><br />Then I dump the whole thing and toss out the 2 lbs of jaggery I bought.<br /><br />No more Indian food.  The irony is that you have a perfect product that nature produces, then you have to adulterate it, overcomplicating it with garbage, making it unacceptable.<br /><br />Attention India and China: I will not participate in your industrial-waste-laundering-through-food scheme.",other
3531,B006JK127K,"Cabernet is by far my favorite wine, and I chanced upon Rex Goliath at my local Publix Supermarket, on sale for $6.19 a bottle.  Having recently learned that I have been hired for a great job, I bought a bottle to celebrate.<br /><br />As someone who has become accustomed to Oak Leaf and ""Three-Buck Chuck"", this was a change for me; spending twice the usual price for wine.

It is very smooth, yet still as full as you expect a Cabernet to be.

They aren't cheap, but they lasted us almost 2 months, so that's not bad.

3539,B000NMI6HY,"I went through a piece of gum while writing this review--maybe 5-10 minutes? If you hate gum that gets stale quick, avoid this like the plague. If you're fine literally going through a pack a day (or a pack every few hours, if you like to constantly chew gum), this isn't bad.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-GREAT, FRESH FLAVOR: I love how intensely minty gum is--the initial burst of flavor is comparable to an Altoids mint. Leaves your mouth feeling very clean. Flavor is much more intense than regular Orbit gum.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-SHORT-LIVED: Gum gets stale just as fast as those $.25 gumball candies. The wonderful flavor lasts about all of 30 seconds before it begins to dissolve into an unappealing, flavorless mass. You know that feeling when your gum tastes gross because it's so old, but you don't have anywhere to throw it away? I get that feeling less than 10 minutes in. A regular individually wrapped piece of Orbit gum could last me over an hour.<br />-NOT TOOTH-WHITENING: That bit of advertising is a bit misleading. I don't think it doesn't anything to whiten teeth moreso than gum normally would--just by nature of being sugarless and picking up pieces of plaque. If you were expecting some tasty tooth whitener, look elsewhere. This doesn't affect my opinion of the gum because I never expected it to, but just throwing it out there.",other

Having transitioned from Starbucks ESE pods, to Illy, and now this - this espresso taste and experience is by far the best.<br />HOWEVER, every pod I have opened has not been packed tightly enough.  So, the first few times I made this espresso, it was horrible.  When I figured out the issue, I have had to open up every pod, dump it into my basket, tamp it down, and make it.  This, obviously, is completely the opposite point of having the pods.  Having used several other companies' pods, it is easy to see (once I ruined a few initial tries) that these pods are significantly looser than anyone else'.  I will not buy the Bristot pods again, but will instead look for just loose grounds, in a can or bag.<br />GREAT ESPRESSO when it is packed right - would never suggest the pods.",other

I steep mine for 5 minutes and sometimes add almond milk or just drink it black.

3549,B001FPWY9O,"These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.

3602,B005CMA1YG,"First off, can I say that I LOVE Nando's? It's a peri-peri restaurant chain that has many branches worldwide and which I know and love as a favorite standby from the UK, but which has only a couple of branches in the US. Neither of those branches are within even a thousand miles of my home in Ohio, so my Nando's fixes are very few and far between. I love that their peri-peri sauces are available in the US, and buy them whenever I can as an all-purpose condiment to serve with anything and everything that could do with a bit of spicing up.<br /><br />Secondly... while I LOVE these sauces, even the ""extra hot"" version doesn't even begin to come close to some of the sauces that real chili-heads will be used to, i.e. the ones that rate so high on the Scoville scale that you're advised to only add them to your food one minuscule drip at a time. Nando's sauces are more of the ""slosh generously all over your plate"" variety if you have any kind of a taste and tolerance for the burny stuff, and I tend to use it more like ketchup than a genuine ""hot"" sauce. That's not meant as an insult to the sauces, though - don't get me wrong, I really do love them, but I get through a whole lot more of this stuff than I do the dangerously hot sauces I buy almost entirely for the burn. Nando's peri-peri sauces are just not like that; they're meant to be enjoyed for their complex flavor rather than as a challenge, so please don't buy a bottle of this stuff expecting to have your head blown off with a single taste.<br /><br />I love the Nando's Extra Hot and Hot sauces as a dip for fries and anything else that requires dunking, and it is also a firm favorite in my household when mixed liberally with a bit of mayo and/or sour cream for a spicy dipping sauce that works well with appetizers of all kinds. It works really well as a marinade for chicken, too - definitely one to try when you're grilling out.<br /><br />My only ""problem"" (and it's not really a problem, as such) is that I get through these little bottles far too quickly. Anyone who's ever been to a Nando's restaurant will know that customers can take as many HUGE bottles (I mean, containing maybe 2-3 pints) of peri-peri sauce in any and every strength and flavor variation back to their table to apply as freely to their meal as they wish. When I try that at home I find I've emptied a $5 bottle of sauce before I know it. I just wish they'd start making it available in stores in industrial-sized bottles for dedicated Nando-lovers such as myself!<br /><br />Finally, if you ever find yourself in a city that has a Nando's restaurant, I'd heartily recommend that you go along and try it out. Order some peri-peri chicken to suit your own personal chili tolerance level, a Portuguese or Brazilian beer and (my personal favorite) a bowl of their spicy mixed nuts to munch on while you wait for your order (these are SERIOUSLY hot and I love them so very, very much) and, well... enjoy! :)",other

3613,B008ADQZ1C,"My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding!

3661,B003QNLV3I,"I love The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Special Dutch Chocolate Powder. I've tried many hot chocolate drinks, and this special Dutch chocolate powder is one of the best. It's flavorful, smooth, and doesn't leave much residue in my mug after I'm done with the hot chocolate. The 22 oz. container is the perfect size to serve your whole family, and it lasts for a while. And you can use the nice container for other stuff after the chocolate powder is gone. This Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Dutch Chocolate Powder mix is multi-functional as well. On the container, there are recipes for not only Hot Chocolate but also Cafe Mocha and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Original Ice Blended Coffee drink. The chocolate powder contains 15% calcium, 4% vitamin C, 2% iron, and five grams of protein per serving size. Since there are no Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores near where I live, it's great to order Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf products online through Amazon or The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's website. I also highly recommend The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Vanilla Caramel flavored coffee, Raspberry Cream flavored coffee, Limited Edition Blueberry Streusel flavored coffee, Blueberry Peach Green Tea, Spring Peach Oolong, and Lemon Chamomile. Anyways, I give a big thumbs up to the Dutch Chocolate Powder mix!",great

When used entirely it tastes more like a milkshake, not a protein shake. I add a teaspoon (more on some days) of Medaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso Coffee when I make my shakes and the taste of the whey protein totally disappears, so if you don't like the taste you can easily hide it by adding a wide range of flavors. Even adding a cup of vanilla yogurt hides the flavor.<br /><br />It dissolves very well in water, milk, and even soy milk, no clumping whatsoever!<br /><br />This is whey protein in it's simplest form with nothing added, so if you are like me and watch what you put into your body, this is a definite must have pantry item.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great taste (well at least I like it)<br />Dissolves well in a variety of liquids<br />Cooks well without adding any unwanted flavor<br />4g of protein per tablespoon<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!",great

3704,B0000E5JRW,"Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<p>New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.  <p>The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the &quot;red kidney bean&quot; popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<p>Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.",great

I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!",great
3730,B000MXJR72,"I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.",other

At least the boxes only have 20 bags, er, sachets, but I'm going to have to use two per cup for the same brew. Also, the box is BIGGER, and each ""sachet"" is INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED (which will keep it fresher, but is very packaging intensive and wasteful and I would much prefer the non-wrapped bags with no string and tab), and each box only has 20 sachets, each of which has less tea than the original bag style.

They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.

It's lovely. Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco. There's some leather and cream too. First sip opens bright with honeyed corn. Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect. Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke. It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best.

I love pepper so this was a nice surprise over the saltier versions we have tried in the past. There is a slight smoky flavor to it, but doesn't overwhelm the beefiness<br /><br />Price: I bought the 3 oz for $7.00 which seems like a good value and the smaller size gave me the opportunity to try the teriyaki and hot cajun.<br /><br />I will definitely order this again and might try the beef sticks, too.",other

If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.

3901,B006BXV1H6,"First off, this did not go over well with our family as a cereal but DID win them over as a Snack mix.  I don't know what the kids were expecting but they didn't like it in milk.  The cereal is no worse than their fave, Bite Sized Chocolate Mini-wheats, so I'm not going to get all self-righteous about the added sugar and all the chocoalte here.  I will say it was a little odd to feel the squish of soft chocolate in your mouth when mixed with the milk.  Rather than toss something that tasted good out, we switched modes and mixed this with rice chex, mini pretzels, unsalted almonds, sunflower seeds and then the KRAVE.  It became a family Snack Fave almost immeditaely.<br /><br />I wish we had a few boxes to try this with so we used coupons and sales to buy some locally and try it again as a SNack with different mixed in non-sugary items.  It seems that no matter what we mixed this with, the Krave was just the right amount of chocolate (loads!) to balance out unsweetened cereals in snack mixes along with some healthy nuts for protein and unsaturated fats.  The key, for us, is portioning. Our family would eat this handful after handful as a mixed snack if we let them so we have to pre-portion it out in reusable tubs with lids.  it goes in lunch boxes and comes out in place of Microwave pocorn when watching a movie.<br /><br />I'd like to see Krave branck out the way that Chex cereals has and offer this in healthy snack bags or better yet, post some snack recipes on their website.  We'll buy it!  The chocolate is creamy and not heard, kinda like Lindt choclate centers while the shell is crunchy like a cereal ought to be.  If you don't mind that in your bowl with milk; you'll love Krave.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/27/12:  When we have seen this on sale and with coupons, we have bought it several times to add to one of the types of Snack Mix we make up by the gallons and store in the old 5 gallon Popcorn tins we've gotten as gifts at Xmas from family.  We put the mix in indivdial, re-usable serving baggies where possible so the kids can just grab one and we know exactly how many calories they've gotten and from what.  The Krave may be a sugary cereal but that melty chocolate middle makes it a good addition to whole grain, unsweetened ingredients such as rolled oats, roasted nuts, Soy nuts and other unsalted crunchies.  it's really all about balance.",other

3908,B000J05MM2,"I'm writing about the single serving convenience packs, offered in a 24-count case, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B000J05MM2"">OFXW116 Walkers Shortbread Fingers Cookies, 2 Cookies/Pack, 24 Packs/Box</a>, which are also available with Subscribe and Save.  They're amazing!  Here's why:<br /><br />1  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case of 24 packs of 2 cookies per package is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  The case of 24 has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S"">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q"">Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.",great

3916,B007ZJ0270,"I just got my shipment today and while to some degree i'm not thrilled with the six separate 3x3 sets, I have to admit they will store in my tool kit much easier being smaller packaging (and take up less very-valuable workspace while working).  I also have to wonder if reordering a specific set of 9 will be easier to replace ones i find frequently useful.  Granted both of these concerns are rather long-term issues, not so much immediate concerns.<br /><br />The reason I so-far give this item 4 stars (and I TOTALLY reserve the right to change my viewpoint) is that they are definitely CAKES of petal dust.  Previously I've worked exclusively with powders, and these cakes do require a bit more work to get the desired amount of dust onto the gumpaste flowers.  As a professional in this industry, however, I feel comfortable knowing that I spent $40+ tax/shipping/etc for 54 colors.  I was at my local hobby store (Michaels) and saw the selection of petal powders by Wilton.  Each individual tube was $4.99 and they only had 10-ish colors for roughly the same amount of petal powder.  This is far more cost effective for producing a variety of flowers for various displays.  And who says I can only make flowers with these dusts?!<br /><br />I'd also like to politely remind anyone using petal-powder style products that these are meant to give your gumpaste work depth and accents, not to entirely color a product.  Using a good reference, you should start your piece with (a leaf, for instance) a yellow or green colored piece of gumpaste and once formed, accent, darken, and shade accordingly with the powders.  Don't expect all the color work to happen with the petal dust on white gumpaste for typical work.",other

If you're searching for the ultimate caramel sauce, this is it! It is thick, buttery-salty, and gets a little chewy when poured over ice cream. We had it slathered on dark chocolate ice cream one day; poured over French Vanilla ice cream the next day. It was so good, I bought a jar to take with me in my suitcase... only realizing afterwards that I couldn't take it in my carry-on luggage because it is considered a ""liquid."" I was very bummed about that! I can't wait until it becomes available to order online. Sign me up for two jars!!",great
3937,B001E11P1W,"This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.",great

3944,B004N0MN26,"As pup-parents to 3 corgies, we've been looking for the perfect chew treat...this is it!<br /><br />Our pups love to chew, but we've had a tough time finding a product we can all live with. Our senior girl has brittle teeth & can't take on anything too hard, our middle-aged boy doesn't digest rawhide well, and the baby of the bunch gets bored easily. As for us, we aren't fond of anything that stains, stinks or stabs at their intestines!<br /><br />Bonies are just right for each pup: hard enough to be chewed on for a while, soft enough to digest without sharp edges. There's no greasy feel or rancid smell. They actually smell pretty good to me and GREAT to the dogs - open the bag & their noses go into overdrive! When finished, there's no evidence left behind (no spots or stains) and the dogs have fresher breath & happy, silly grins. By contrast, Greenies are too soft for them (more like something to eat,than something to chew), plus we've always been leery of giving them a wheat-based product.<br /><br />Hooray for Bonies!",great

Now, there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable.  But my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with Eagle Pack.  He seems to do best on the Lamb variety and the Duck variety.  The Turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason.  I think the price and quality make us both happy, for now.

3965,B004GA35HU,"I am a self professed chili-head and this is my take on this assortment of fine pepper sauces.  I came home from work on a Friday evening and was delighted to find that this package had arrived.  I immediately opened the carton and grabbed a sleeve of saltine crackers, so I started the ultimate taste test.  One by one I tried a few drops of each sprinkled on top of a cracker.  Well just after finishing number six (Dave's Ghost Pepper), the wife arrived, walking into the kitchen she looked at me and asked ""Why are you crying?"" I replied ""I can't help it! The world is so cruel !"".<br />In my opinion the best tasting sauces in this assortment are Blair's and Mad Dog 357.  Blair's is probably the mildest in terms of heat and has a sweet almost tomato like flavor.  Mad Dog, a very hot sauce with smoky BBQ type flavor is probably my favorite.  All of these sauces have decent flavor, but with the exception of Mad Dog, the hottest sauces tend to end with a metallic after taste.<br /><br />Absolutely, and without any doubt Dave's Ghost is the hottest of all in this selection.  Although it has a good flavor, it's usefulness is questionable.  I am unable to add enough quantity of it to a dish to impact flavor without raising the heat to almost intolerable levels.<br />This stuff is extremely hot!!",great
