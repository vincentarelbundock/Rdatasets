2,B000G7V394,"I have been a consumer of Snyders hard sourdough pretzels for over 12 years.  For a while I could find them locally however,  It seems that they just disappeared for unknown reason.  I wanted to have those baked sourdough twists and I had to settle for another brand.  They were no where near as good as Snyders.<br />My wife who is an employee at Amazon said to try online there,  I did and walla' there they werein a box of 12, that was great and they were even at a reduced cost.  Thanks",great
3,B004WJAULO,"This tastes so bad, I'm considering throwing it away.  But I'll probably punish myself for buying 3 boxes of 18 pods by watering down by mixing each with one medium roast Senseo pod for my second cup of coffee each day until they're gone. Don't punish yourself. Just don't buy it.",other
4,B003D4MBOS,This product is way too pricey to have so little chocolate taste. The predominate flavor is grape which isn't on the list of ingredients. Unless invert sugar is derived from grapes?? Definitely not recommended.,other
5,B0030Z95B2,"I bought this for my Mom as a gift to accompany her Dolce Gusto maker & she loves how it displays the flavors & keeps her from reaching into a box.  It doesn't *look* like it holds all it says, but it does!<br /><br />You'll be happy with your purchase of this capsule carousel!",great
6,B000LRH4WE,"This thing is 7 dollars in US?I know its exported from Cyprus(its Cypriot,from the Greek Cypriots,not strictly Greek),so the selling price went that high.Anyway this is not even a traditional village halloumi but a factory halloumi and its not even the best brand,so in no way it is worth that much(in my country is somewhere between 1 dollar-Am Cypriot)for a factory Halloumi.If you try the traditional Halloumi from villages you will understand.I laughed at the selling price.",other

9,B0085NFX2O,"Grilled out brats, chicken, and burgers for the entire family yesterday.  Covered all of it with Country Bob's seasoning and all purpose sauce!  The family loved it.  Best sauce available!!  Can't wait to use it on my steaks tonight!",great
10,B000LRH7XK,"I ordered 4 cans of this product.  The product is fine, but 3 of the 4 cans were dented.  Many people will say there is nothing wrong with dented cans, but I prefer undented cans.  I have read many reviews regarding dented cans from Amazon, but do not know if Amazon gets them dented, therefore can sell them for less. They were still wrapped individually so would appear they were packed dented.",other
11,B000GB3LRM,"This is one of my favorite teas. This tea is very light, but still is a great morning pick-me-up. The orange and lemongrass balance so well with the black tea that this tea does not need anything added like milk or sweetener. This is definitely a tea I will always keep in stock.",great
12,B001EQ4HWG,The product is fresh BUT I have bitten into a few nut shell fragments and this is unsatisfactory especially from a dental viewpoint.,other
13,B000F9FG28,"I grew up in a family of tea drinkers; and although I now tend to have a lot of coffee while I'm at work, I still drink almost exclusively tea when I'm at home. I generally prefer loose leaf teas - that way I know I'll get ""the real thing,"" whereas tea bags tend to contain merely the leftovers of a harvest; little crumbs too poor in aromatic and other content to otherwise pass quality control standards.<br /><br />The exception are Bigelow teas: and first and foremost among those their flagship, Ruth Bigelow's original ""Constant Comment"" with its recipe of black tea, orange grind and holiday spices (primarily cinnamon). Created by Mrs. Bigelow on the basis of an old colonial recipe over half a century ago, the blend soon became so popular among her friends that their ""constant comments"" of approval prompted Ruth and husband David Bigelow to found their own tea company. Since then, ""Constant Comment"" has long become a true classic ... and if you love tea, it is indeed the perfect refreshment; whether or not it's Christmas time. (E.g., it also makes for great iced tea in summer; particularly if you add a bit of lemon.)<br /><br />If you're making more than a single cup of tea, and unless you like your tea *very* weak, you may want to rethink the company's measuring directions - based on the the ""one bag per cup"" ratio, you'll likely need two or more bags for an entire pot (depending on size), even when steeping an extra minute or two. That said, though ... wanna come over for a cuppa?",great
14,B000RJMBJM,These are tasty but expensive for how many you actually get. I ordered them for a baby shower and everyone seemed to enjoy them. they are cute but probably not worth the expensive cost plus shipping. I was stuck in a time crunch so it worked out but would not re-buy.,other
15,B001FKWLD8,I have been searching for this candy forever and finally found it through Amazon. It arrived very quickly and I was very pleased with it.,great
16,B003MZ69IW,Somebody sent a package of this to where I work and it was FABULOUS. The one I had was two ounces in a shrink-wrapped package. Would be great for hiking or wherever a single portion is wanted.,great
17,B0002IMRVU,"At first, they came out flat and sad looking, but after I increased the thickness slightly (1/4 inch) and cooked them at a higher temperature (med high on stove top) they came out grand!!! They really do taste like the ones in the French Quarter.  I'm so grateful to have found this mix because nobody makes these around here.  I get blank stares in all the bakeries when I ask for Beignets.",great
18,B000JKJJHG,"The first word that comes into mind when I think about this set is ""PERFECT"" it just is!<br /><br />I bought another set from the same vendor a while back as a gift for my fatherbut I wasn't very impressed (check my review) I found this set a few weeks later and let me tell you, this is exactly what I was looking for. I'll be reordering soon!<br /><br />One thing I can tell you is that you really have to be a HOT HOT sauce lover in order to enjoy this set, this is no joke. You have been warned.",great
19,B0026W9TLQ,This was the lousiest jerkey that i ever tasted.  I've had oberto many times and was satisfied. But this had to of been processed from some dead horse laying on the side of the highway for years.  Never again will i eat Oberto Jerky.,other
20,B0009YJ4CW,"I bought the Everlasting Treat Ball (Large sized) for my 45 lb mixed breed dog, who is an aggressive chewer. This is the same dog that went through a red Kong in a day, and a Kong Extreme in a few months, and will liquefy any tennis ball in seconds. I heard great reviews on this and read about it in a book as well, and after MONTHS of debate decided to pick this up at my local pet store when it was on sale. I just gave it to her less than 20 minutes ago and she already has several chunks out of it.<br /><br />It did ""challenge"" her for a few minutes, as I put kibble and treats inside. She got the disk out in a few minutes and enjoyed that (chicken flavor) then went crazy getting at the food inside. So crazy, that she has taken several chunks out of the plastic already. And eaten them. Great. She did seem to have fun rolling it around getting the food out, but then went to chewing on the plastic.<br /><br />For a replacement, I got the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0009YHTYC"">Everlasting Fun Ball Large</a> in large from the same company- and its been over a week so far and she loves that toy!!! Its basically the same thing as this instead it is actually a green ball with more room for treats inside, and made of more durable material. Also, unlike the treat ball, it does not have any ridges for my dog to bite into and rip pieces off. And, its a bit cheaper. I'm writing this after I've had that ball for at least 6 months, and she plays with it EVERY DAY and there isn't even a mark in the thing.<br /><br />So, all in all, skip this and go for the FUN BALL instead!!!",other

22,B0080XSES4,"ICV D-47<br />Saccharomyces cerevisiae<br /><br />Origin<br />This strain was isolated from grapes grown in the C�tes-du-Rh�ne region of France by Dr. Dominique Delteil, head of the Microbiology Department, Institut coop&eacute;ratif du vin (ICV), in Montpellier. ICV D-47 strain was selected from 450 isolates collected between 1986 and 1990.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The ICV D-47 is a low-foaming quick fermenter that settles well, forming a compact lees at the end of fermentation. This strain tolerates fermentation temperatures ranging from 15� to 20�C (59� to 68�F) and enhances mouthfeel due to complex carbohydrates. Malolactic fermentation proceeds well in wine made with ICV D-47.<br /><br />Recommended for making wines from white varieties such as Chardonnay and ros&eacute; wines. An excellent choice for producing mead, however be sure to supplement with yeast nutrients, especially usable nitrogen.<br /><br />An excellent choice for dry whites, blush wines and residual sugar wines.",great
23,B005TY1HYK,"First, let me point out that you should get 2 bottles of this oil and it is NOT ""light"" olive oil.  It is extra virgin and organic.  The taste is smooth with a bit of peppery finish.  It is certainly a bit pricey so I am not using it as a general cooking oil.  I use it for salads, drizzling on tomatoes and broiling, and if I ate bread, I'd mix this with garlic and herbs and black pepper--YUM!  Hope you enjoy it :)<br />By the way, when I got my order, it only had one bottle and as I bought it thinking it was ""light"", I was really disappointed.  But the customer service from Baker's Box was excellent.  They let me keep the bottle and refunded my money, since it is not the product as advertised.",great
24,B003BSO6CQ,"I have used ""crystal"" type litter for several years now and they are absolutely fantastic. There is absolutely no smell or dealing with urine clumps and whatnot. In my experience, all crystal litter has performed in this manner.<br /><br />I used to use PETCO brand crystal litter. This is a great litter but the rocks are big and often got stuck between my cats paws and would be dragged into the room (or at the very least all around the outside of his litter box). These Micro-Crystals are far superior to the petco litter at the same price point.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Very fine litter, does not get stuck in my cats paws or spread anywhere (In fact, I have not seen ANY of it spill outside his box yet and I have been using it for roughly 3 weeks)<br />-NO smell<br />-Once a month; just scoop the poop don't worry about the urine at all until you swap the whole thing out.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Dusty when the cat uses it or when changing it out (due to how fine the crystals are)<br />**This is a minor problem because I keep my litter box next to my toilet (easily scoop the poop) so if I go into the bathroom right after my cat, it is a little dusty. It settles very fast though (a minute or so is plenty to wait)<br /><br />Overall, I definitely would recommend these as the #1 type of cat litter I have ever used. I have had cats for over 20 years and am exclusively switching to these. The ONLY issue I have seen with them is the dust that is kicked up after my cat uses the box, but this settles so quickly it is not an issue.",great
25,B0011SAELK,"These pickled eggs are my new favorite . Nice and firm on the outside like you'd expect . They're sweet with a hint of mild vinegar favor . Not overpowering at all . The red coloring is almost purple on the outside and more of a pink on the inside . The best part is the yolk , flavorful and delicious . I only wish that they were available in larger jars because these are going to disappear in a flash .",great

27,B003YF15CU,"If you enjoy the culinary delight of adding your own fresh ground spices these Spice Appeal Muntok White Peppercorns are for you.

I highly recommend you indulge your tastebuds, while pampering your wallet.",great
28,B008B80MBU,"Great Tasting Natural almond Butter, Please note that this is NATURAL almond butter and it does not contain any hydrogenated oils or other chemicals/additives (like most other major brands), so you will have to stir it or mix it when you get it home since the oil will separate and make it runny on top and very firm at the bottom.

34,B00024CW1O,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>While this review features the book, COCONUT OIL MIRACLE, it displays and describes other products [including coconut oil] which that book catalyzed into a healing synergy. I've reviewed most of the products shown in this video.<br /><br />Johanna Galt, thank you for your comment and question posted under the original written review I had submitted here, which I've deleted and replaced with this video [6/25/10]. Most of the content below was written in response to your question.<br /><br />I had purchased this brand a few years ago, and to be honest, I don't recall much about the flavor.  It was my first experience cooking with coconut oil, and I hadn't yet read any books on it.  The brands I've used recently and favor most for quality, aroma, and flavor are:<br /><br />EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Both of those brands, from my experience, are excellent quality.<br /><br />When I read <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049"">The Coconut Oil Miracle (by Bruce Fife)</a> I learned a greater variety of uses of the oil and how to work with its relatively hard texture.  I had kept it in the refrigerator until I read Fife's book and learned the oil [if it's in good condition when purchased] could be safely kept in the cupboard, usually for a year or more.  There's lots of interesting, valuable information in that book, which helped me conveniently expand my usage of this miracle oil.<br /><br />I had recently read the later reviews on this NOW Foods offering and had felt that possibly I was lucky to get a better quality batch than some of those reviewers, because I don't recall the oil tasting off.  But after reading those reviews and experiencing what might be higher quality products [linked above], I will probably stay with EFAGold or Nutiva, but I'm curious enough to try the NOW Foods product on this page again for flavor and purity comparison, in case the poor reviews came from an uncommon occurrence of a bad batch of the product.<br /><br />The EFAGold jar I received seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but Nutiva is very near as good, and sometimes priced more economically.  The information on some of the Amazon product pages for Nutiva is interesting, very helpful, and impressive.  I'm now cooking so much with the oil that I bought the larger size, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz.  But I will also keep the 15 oz jars, as they're convenient to take with me away from home.<br /><br />To be fair, I should buy this NOW brand again to compare it to these others which I've experienced.  I've used other NOW Foods products and have been pleased with them.<br /><br />I've noticed additional brands available on Amazon which look good, too.  From the information in Fife's book, I might try any oil which is cold pressed [ANH, absolutely no heat] and extra virgin.<br /><br />I LOVE cooking with coconut oil.  It seems to me to enhance the integrity of the flavor of the food it's used with, and the savory flavor of beef steaks and other stronger meats can be furthered and the coconut edge removed by use of garlic, onions, and salty spices added to the oil when cooking.<br /><br />Some of my reviews on the above linked product pages give different information from this one, and hopefully more helpful written information from the original one which had been posted here.  In view of some of the comments and the collected ""NO"" votes on that review, I decided to post this video, to delete the original written review, and plan to include a copy of it at the end of the first 6 comments which had been made on the original review.<br /><br />May pleasant aromas follow your nose,<br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />NOTE: If you have a magnesium deficiency like many people are experiencing now, feel free to read some of my reviews on magnesium products for information about ways to retain that index mineral into your system at adequate levels.  Most coconut oil has a lot of potassium in it, which can replace some of the needed magnesium.",great
35,B001EPPJJW,"I am an avid Earl Grey tea drinker (about 4 cups/day) and generally prefer loose tea.  Without realizing the vendor I choose to give this product a try.  Tea is not too bad, perhaps a bit bland, but not so weak as to warrent two bags per cup. Tea is no worse than Twinings or other mass market products, certainly drinkable and packets are portable and simple to use.  This is no where near the caliber of most loose teas.  One product I do recommend is Kusmi Anastasia tea.<br /><br />As a footnote, I would warn you against purchasing loose tea from Tea District.  I generally purchase by the pound and ordered a pound of tea before I was in dire need of a refill.  After it arrived I stored it in my dry cool basement until it was needed.  In the time it took me to finish my current batch, the tea district tea spoiled - the sealed mylar bag smelled of spoiled oranges or rotten feet or maybe both.  Tasted about as bad too.  Company told me I waited more than 30 days to complain so it's my problem.  Wasn't cheap and wasn't consumable.  If you're looking at loose tea from Tea District, purchase small sample bags not the large sealed bags or better yet, look elsewhere.",other

42,B005OJYRYM,I was looking for that extra something as a joint gift to my grandparents. I got them individual gifts but it did not seem enough so I got this for them as well. When they opened it they seemed excited about the gift and looking forward to seeing the contents. I then asked them later how they liked it and my grandmother said it was no good and the candy was stale. Well that was embarassing. I love buying Christmas presents and finding unique and fun things for my loved ones. I dont get to do a lot for my family normally like most people on a tight budget. I feel let down by the company and sad that the point of the gift wasn't able to be achieved. I would not buy this again and would sadly not be able to recommend it. I think it is a neat idea but the quality of the candy was no good.,other

45,B005H19RQA,"The first reviewer complains that this is not 100% Cherry Juice and that the provider is lying.  When I buy a product that has Cherry and Grape in the name, my expectation is not that it is 100% Cherry with no other fruit juices.  I would carefully analyze all the facts before I resorted to accusing anyone or any company of lying.

I have never had the positive results that others have had from eating fresh cherries and drinking cherry juice.  But, this beverage seems to help.  I suspect the secret is in the grape seed extract.  This is a by product of wine making and is reportedly very high in antioxidants.  It is one of the few products that contains grape seed extract.

57,B000LKZ90A,"I have made macaroni and cheese using this pasta several times and am now hooked.  One thing I must say is that it is IMPERATIVE that the water for the pasta be in a full boil before adding the pasta to the water -- otherwise you end up with a slimy slush.  Other than that, the only other things to worry about are a)overcooking and b)overeating.<br /><br />For leftovers, the pasta dish must be covered and thoroughly reheated until very hot, else the pasta will be leathery.  If you find the reheated pasta is like leather, you just need to cover and microwave a little longer.<br /><br />IMO this pasta tastes *better* than non GF versions -- and it had better, given the price, right?  Even so, I've taken off one star for the price because these are SO much more expensive than the non GF version (which can be purchased for 1/3 the price per unit...as in 99 cents).  However perhaps this might explain the expense -- the box containing the bags of pasta was marked ""Product of Italy"".",other
58,B005SPHEPQ,"I have two kids with food allergies so I am very limited to what I can use in the house. Between two of them, we can't have milk, eggs, soy, wheat, nuts, and corn. So what is left?? only rice milk (well, I tried oat, sunflower, hemp, etc but I could not get used to the taste). I usually buy rice milk from refridgerated section at the supermarket. I needed poweder milk to use for baking and to mix with my coffee. When you mix this powder with any liquid, it does not disolve well and you have to mix it very well. I usually have to use a back of spoon against a cup and stir multiple times. Other than that, the task is good (well it is not like MILK, as you know) and it does give choices to people with food allergies. So, I really appreciated that they came up with this product. If you can take regular milk, you might want to stick with milk. But if you have food allergies, this is a good alernative product to purchase.",other
59,B0002G348C,I was a little hesitant about the instructions for cooking this mix when I first opened up the package; I didnt think it would be ready in the time they gave (5 minutes of boiling & then removing the pot from the burner and leaving it covered for 1/2 an hour). I added a mixture of chicken & fish and was pleasantly surprised when I lifted the lid to my pot and saw that the jambalaya was ready to eat! I'm definitely ordering this mix again!<br /><br />A word of caution! They mix was a little spicy.

61,B00247AU8Y,"I have 3 different flavors on these and they are : jalape&ntilde;o , apple wood ,a and hickory. I so far think hickory has the best smoke taste but apple wood has more bacon flavor. Jalape&ntilde;o is good but not the best . All these products do and will add complex flavor to your food. They add great smoke and subtle bacon flavor. You can smell the bacon and taste it on most foods. I think it is the best on chicken. I disagree with the people that say there is hardly any bacon flavor and I think you guys have poor palates. Do not expect this to make your food taste like it was wrapped by 90 pieces of bacon for Pete's sake! No seasoning is meant to achieve this level of flavor and if you want full bacon taste then buy bacon and eat it!

Highly recomended and it will always be in my spice cupboard .",other

67,B0051XFUQA,"Ordered the Acana Ranchlands because of the reviews that I saw on various websites.  The dog (Miniature Poodle) liked it so-so, and then the worst part was his stool became really, really (!!) HARD on this food.  Tried other Acana varities (e.g., Grasslands) - and had the same result.  He was nearly constipated on the Acana and had a very tough time trying to pass a stool.  Then the stool itself had a very hard consistency - not at all normal.<br /><br />So, for the money, I would say pass this up and go for something else!!  We've switched to Taste of the Wild (which is also grain free) and are finding that the dog loves it as much - if not more - and aren't having any of the stool issues that we did with Acana.",other

It has a freshness and authenticity that I've not found in any other packaged sauce, and works well on its own or as a base (I like to add canned clams for a quick red clam sauce).<br /><br />But, the Italian Sausage and Mushroom takes the Rao's tradition of flavor and quality in a new and wonderful direction.  Rather than a simple red sauce, this sauce has complex flavors, with the savory mushrooms and sweet Italian sausage mixing well with fresh herbs in a rich red base.  Rao's bills this sauce as ""Dinner to Go,"" and that's fair.  You really don't need to do anything to it -- just heat it up and serve over some good quality pasta with some good grated cheese.<br /><br />My local grocer used to carry this sauce, and I was very disappointed when they dropped it from their lineup of Rao's sauces.

But most grain free foods contain white potatoes which are very high carbohydrate. The allergic dog can tend to overweight so I also try to limit her carbohydrate intake. Zeal is one of the lowest carbohydrate foods HK makes. The food is very easy to re-hydrate. Just add equal amounts of food and water, stir, and wait 5-10 minutes.

Until recently I was used to having a Diet Coke each morning, but wasn't really thrilled about the chemicals that diet soda packs. I was already a fan of the V8 Fusion drinks, so when I found out about V-8's Fusion + Energy drinks, I was thrilled to have a better option available.<br /><br />Unlike the 100% juice V8 Fusion drinks, the V8 Fusion + Energy drinks combine the fruit and vegetable juices with green tea, so you get a hefty dose of caffeine in addition to a full serving of fruits and veggies (and the vitamins that come with it) in one 50-calorie serving. The green tea does alter the taste quite a lot from the non-caffeinated V8 Fusion drinks, but it's still pretty tasty, especially the Peach Mango flavor.<br /><br />One thing that's worth pointing out is that this little can has quite a bit more caffeine than a can of diet soda, so you may need to modify the amount of caffeine you take in later in the day. Most of the time, one can has all the caffeine I need for the day.<br /><br />These V8 Fusion + Energy drinks are a great tasting, and mostly healthy, alternative to diet sodas as well as the crazy chemical/stimulant concoctions like Red Bull and Monster.

102,B005DOPTJU,"I found these for sale at Wal-Mart, and I would recommend getting them there unless an online price changes and happens to out do the convenience of buying local.  For 24 bottles I paid about $30.<br /><br />Onward to the product review.<br /><br />So I have been using these off and on since our baby boy was born in the hospital, where they supplemented him using this product while his mothers breast milk came in.  Today almost a month later we are still using this product.<br /><br />I have had some mixed results with this product, causing my son to have some gas, reflux, spit-ups, and rare vomiting (although not exclusively Enfamil's fault), but for the most part he seems to keep this down and enjoy it.  It also seems to mix fairly friendly with his moms breast milk, so if my boy is really hungry I can confidently give him both and not cause issue.<br /><br />If you can get around the price, reason with yourself, because let me tell you how convenient this product really is: The product comes in a ready-to-go bottle, and all you have to do is attach a screw-on nipple.  This is perfect for when you are up at 3AM feeding your baby (when you are tired as hell) and you have no breast milk around, or when you're out and about and you just want to quickly feed your baby.<br /><br />I have had great success using this product with my son versus using another powdered make-it-yourself product, wherein my baby was much more pleased to drink and digest this product from the latter.<br /><br />The shelf life is pretty good because you can keep this bottle out at room temperature for an hour, and store it in the refrigerator for about 2 hours or so.  Honestly, that's great because it is often the case that your baby is going to drink the entire bottle or close to it when you start your feeding anyway.<br /><br />So although the price is not as cheap as some others... the convenience factor, paired with the amount per bottle for a feeding, really makes this product worth it.

I thought it was me just getting used to it, but it is not.  I have become very frustrated with Torani's tampering with and reformulating their syrups.  Even compared to their ""sugar-ful"" syrup, I find that I have to use almost twice as much of this product.  I have found a similar story with other Torani Sugar-Free syrups.  It seems they are making up for the trivial cost of the artificial sweetener and giving you less.<br /><br />As a result, I have been trying many other sugar-free (and sugar-ful) syrups -- and spending a lot, too.  In comparison, Monin O'Free chocolate syrup is roughly 2X as flavorful/concentrated, but sadly, it is about 2X as much cost.  Plus, you may have to pay S/H.  While the Torani flavor is pretty good (slight chemical taste), the Monin is a bit malty, so I would give the Torani the edge.  I have also tried DaVinci's sugar-free chocolate syrup.  It probably has the best taste, but like Torani, it is watered down.  DaVinci's is a bit more on the bittersweet side.

We used this blend to experiment with our new single-serve coffee maker, the Jura Ena Micro 1.  This is basically an espresso maker, but it can make several strengths, and besides espresso shots, it makes ristretto and lungo cups also. We found the Major Dickason's Blend to taste rich and full-flavored made as an intense shot and also as a milder 12 oz. regular cup of coffee. Can't get much better than that!

They are a little stronger than the generic white and red peppermint hard-candies that restaurants set out in bowls, and these give you a nice cool sensation like a york or junior mint. As these mints age (say a year), they also mellow.<br /><br />With so much mint gum, it's hard to find a good mint tablet.  Many alternatives have caffeine, crunchy shells, or are uncomfortably intense.  Not these. They are just perfectly balanced.<br /><br />I stumbled across these mints about two years ago on a 3000 mile road trip.  Since then, I've purchased several 9-pack boxes.  I've never seen these at stores since my original purchase.  Dentyne has a companion flavor to these ""ICE"" mints, called Fire.

I used to have a habit of waking up hungry and ""sleep-eating"" when I'd get up to use the bathroom.  I've retrained myself to grab a mint instead.  Since they are sugar free, they don't rot my teeth.  And, since they aren't too strong... they don't wake me up too much.  I just suck on the mint until I fall back to sleep.",great

As previously mentioned, the root beer taste is not knock-you-over intense, but with the Sodastream, I can adjust it to the exact water/flavor mix I want! If you're looking for a very strong root beer taste, I'd recommend Virgil or Boylan. They're sold in bottles and are both VERY strong!<br /><br />Second, each 750ml bottle will make 6 liters (approximately 25 8-oz servings) of all-natural soda. At $15, this is far cheaper than the other natural sodas you find at the store (Blue Sky, Thomas Kemper, Hansen, etc).<br /><br />I prefer this natural root beer to the other soda flavors I've tried from Sodastream and will buy it again!",great

That said, I was disappointed with this as a gift, as the box was much smaller than I expected and the unattractive, very loose ribbon made a weak presentation.

210,B0043GF610,"My wife has been buying the 28 ounce bags if this very simple but brilliant conceived product.  The only ingredients seem to be Roasted Almonds a very light amount of sea salt and barely enough to taste it Evaporated Cane Juice crystals.  The Roasted almonds seem to be dusted with the small amounts of salt and sugar and then put into a press and dried until they are one big sheet of uniform thickeness which is then cut to uniform size with really sharp industrial size blades.  If you count each square and only eat the # of sqaures that = 1 serving, you won't get fat and the leftover bits in the bottom make a nice addition to whole grain hot cereals or to homemade chex mix.  My wife eats this stuff as a filling, protein & fiber rich snack or even as part of her lunch with fruit and  a salad of dark greens & veggies.  It doesn't spike her blood sugar ( she has to watch hers since it swings very low and very high).  Also, when she's feeling a low blood sugar headache coming on, she reaches into her purse and eats either half or a whole a serving of this  very vasic snack with some water for fast relief.<br /><br />The genius is in the uniformity of the squares for portion control.  If you count them  and only eat 6 generously sized pieces, you will only get  156 calories, 3 grams of sugar and  5 et carbs when you subtract the fiber (fiber has to be listed as a carb by law).  Once you get used to the amount,  you can figure out how much of the fallen odd bits in the bottom equal 1 serving or do what we do and toss it in with some non-sugar ceareal and a little bit of Cinnamon toast crunch so the kids will have a ""sweet Snack"" that ain't actually as sweet as they imagine it is!  (we're sneaky parents! oh noes!)  To get this ""semi-sweet sback mix,"" we mix 2/3'rds  wheat chex & generic rice krisps with 1/3 Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, shake that up with the leftover broken off bits of toasted almonds from 2 large bags of Mr's Mays Almond crunch, right inside the Mr.s May's Re-sealable bags,  and we get a nice snack we can dole out in 1 cup servings.  You can stretch this mix even further by adding air-popped popcorn and handing it out in kid decorated ""popcorn bags"" made from grocery store bags and have a nice family movie night complete with a less sinful snack.  Just be sure and scoop up from the bottom to get some of those heart-healthy almonds in your ""portion"" since the almonds have a way of hading at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I realize I sound a lot like ""Mr. Snack Hacker"" here on Amazon but in these times of rising food prices it would be shameful to let any part of a healthy snack go to waste and often times just by mixing up something new from something they've had before can re-interest kids in a healthy snack.

These are advertised online as ""contains no high fructose corn syrup"" and the list of ingredients did not contain corn syrup (they were listed as ""Glucose syrup; sugar; modified corn starch; Acidulants: malic acid, citric acid; Gelling agent: Gellan; flavours; Acidity regulator: trisodium citrate; Concentrates of fruits and plants (orange, elderberry, lemon, aronia, black currant, apple, kiwi, spinach, nettle); elderberry extract; fructose; invert sugar syrup."")<br /><br />When I ripped open the first package, the first bite was amazing, but the constancy seemed to be too perfect, so I immediately checked the ingredients.  Imagine my surprise to see that the very first ingredient listed was . . . drumroll please . . . CORN SYRUP. While I know that some might argue that corn syrup and high fructose syrup are distinct, the fact remains that corn syrup was not listed on the website, and that taken along with the ""no high fructose corn syrup"" would imply that there was no corn syrup in the candy.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, the candies were actually pretty good, but don't think that you are getting corn syrup free candies.  Also be aware that there are 2.9 servings per package, so it's going to be 350 calories if you down the entire package (which is easy to do, as the candies are pretty big and there aren't very many per package).

I like the Classic Med. heat packages best because I can make several types of salsa from the same packet. For those who cant stand much heat, I might just add some chopped green pepper & onion. Add some finely chopped cilantro if you want. My favorite is extra chopped green pepper & onion, finely chopped cilantro & either a chopped habenero or jolokia pepper for a great HOT salsa. Just add it all to the blender & ""chop"" it to the consistency you desire, give it 5-6 minutes for the flavours to blend & you have the freshest salsa you can get.",great

312,B001VNFHLC,"I was so excited to receive my first dutch-processed cocoa powder especially after all the wonderful reviews of the Frontier one on Amazon.<br /><br />I was first apprehensive about the 'Organic Herbal Essence' - 'Frontier' mixup but when I saw a big red rimmed label with ""Frontier"" in green on the bag along with USDA Organic & Fair Trade mark/logos among other print, I quickly opened the bag and took out a spoonful of the powder to examine. I was slightly disappointed in the color, as I've read that dutch-processed cocoa powder had a deeper and sometimes redder color. I took out my box of natural, unsweetened Trader Joes cocoa powder and saw that the dutch-processed cocoa was darker and slightly redder in color in comparison, though not as much as I had hoped (and certainly not as deep as the picture on Amazon).<br /><br />I've also read that dutch-processed cocoa has a richer 'chocolatier' fragrance to it and so I took a whiff from the bag. To my dismay, a medicinal, acidic, spicey smell met my unsuspecting nose. I once again grabbed my Trader Joe's unalkalized cocoa powder and it smelled more 'chocolatier' than the Frontier bag. The expiration date is sometime in 2014 so I believe I either got a bad bag or this product is definitely not up to the hype. I even tried to mix some in my cup of coffee, as another reviewer had and raved about, and it tasted so.. 'off' and unappealing I had to mix in some sugar (I dont usually sweeten my coffee) and gulp down the rest (I hate wasting food and the coffee beans were kind of expensive heh).<br /><br />I'm still searching for a good dutch-processed cocoa powder, which is more difficult to find than I had hoped.. Thinking of looking into E Guittard, Pernigotti, or Green & Black next, at the recommendation of others, and Penzeys or Valrhona as last resorts (not available where I live and shipping is a killer). I'd suggest anyone looking for dutch-processed cocoa powder to skip this product and try the next option instead.",other

323,B001ACPIUE,"A longer review than I would usually write for food but since there's 4 different items, I address the set as a whole and each of the different snacks/cookies.<br /><br />Warning for allergy eaters: This is on the back of the box in small print ""Contains Milk, Wheat, Soy, processed in a facility that uses eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts"".<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to get a variety pack since I had never tried her packaged snacks and small enough that if you don't like them or get allergic to something, you don't have a whole lot to give away and feel you wasted alot of money.<br /><br />*CHEESE STRAWS are the second biggest pro but I would like to buy them on their own in a larger package in the future.<br /><br />* CHEESE STRAWS stay crunchy, taste great, no aftertaste<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Okay, this may seem like a contradiction because I love that I can get a small variety pack in order to try something out - if I got a full box, it would be plenty but once you open the box and then open the little bag stuffed in the bottom, you barely get anything in each package.  No offense but what a waste of a beautiful package/box for less than two servings of a snack.  If you eat a couple here and a couple there (of cheese straws) you could make the package last two days.  If there's two people having two here and two there, and they have complete self control and are very conscious of limiting your portion sizes (people who have the ability to eat 4 potato chips and not go back until tomorrow) I'd give it an hour, or less. For me, the cheese straws lasted an hour - I put them away three times. There's certainly not enough to put in a little nut size bowl and set it out on the coffee table if you are having a couple people over.  This is literally a sample packet put into a box that's made to look like you are getting a full box of treats.<br /><br />One open box is 7"" tall and 3 1/2"" wide.  Inside the box is a gold bag that is about 5""x4 1/2"".  But the contents of the bag is 4 1/2"" wide and only 2"" tall.  For the cookies, because they are so sweet/strong you can make them last a few days, and they are tiny (size of a quarter for the pineapple cookies), so just a few will do for the chocolate cookies and pineapple cookies. But still, nowhere near putting them in a nut-size small bowl unless you combine them all.<br /><br /> *All snacks except for the cheese straws, change texture in less than 5 minutes of being open.  Immediately transfer to a tightly closed ziploc or tight lidded ""tupperware"" type container.  They all are crunchy when opened but after a couple of minutes, the pineapple and the shortbread go from firm , crunchy pecan sandies to falling apart crumbly and can't hold the cookie as a solid piece, the Chocolate marsh go from solid crunchy to a stale chewy texture.  The texture changed before I put them away the very first time and each time I only had a couple cookies and decided to put them away but the texture already changed dramatically.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br /><br />CHEESE STRAWS -<br />If you've had Paula Deen's Macaroni and Cheese - which I was able to find online - and you like it, the Cheese Straws taste very much like the Macaroni and Cheese.  It has a strong Cheddar flavor but not quite ""Sharp cheddar"" or ""mild cheddar"", more like a medium with a stronger taste than medium.  It also seems like it is a multi cheese, but I don't know what other cheese is in it. I ate them and tossed the box the night I got them.  They look like crinkle fries, fatter than my pinky,crunchy when opened and they stay that way-while I had them out and each time I went back for more,still crunchy and very good.  No funky after taste (like two others).<br /><br />PINEAPPLE DROP COOKIES - Quarter size, very very strong pineapple taste, with a very very sweet powdered sugar on top that tastes like it has pineapple (or something?) flavoring too.  Bitter after taste, way too strong, crunchy in a ""pecan sandies"" like texture, unless they are out for a couple minutes, then they crumble.  I had two cookies with a few minutes in between because it was so very strong I didn't know if I really wanted another one.  When I reached in the tiny bag for the second cookie, they were already crumbly.  I couldn't have a 3rd and instead gave them away - they were just terrible, although I usually love pineapple, love sandies type cookies, and love powdered sugar.  But there was nothing good about these.<br /><br />COCONUT PECAN BARS - about 2"" long rounded top rectangle, they were mostly broken but that was okay.  These too are like a ""pecan sandies"" texture to start with, good crunch, but does turn soft and crumbly very quickly. The initial flavor is very good, like a powdered sugar covered pecan sandy with a hint of coconut flavor and obvious pieces of coconut once you chew the cookie, and pecan flavor, but very little in the way of tiny pecan pieces.  The main problem is the awful after taste that lasted way too long-not bitter like the pineapple but just as funky. Worse than that is that the after taste isn't recognizable. It isn't coconut, isn't pecan, it's what I usually call ""chemically"" because it's not a food flavor. Even strong coffee didn't get rid of it. But I did have four of them before tossing the other 6-8 cookies in the trash.  First 2 were the original texture and the last two fell apart in my hand, like a handful of sand with some coconut.  Literally, not 3 minutes after the first two I ate, the last two were like a totally different cookie, could not hold itself together and the sandies crunch was gone replaced by crumbled ingredients that made the shredded coconut much more obvious (not bad if you like coconut, which I do)but no longer a cookie, more a pile of crumbs. But the after taste is a product killer, I just couldn't have any more.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE MARSH MUD COOKIES-  The best sweet in the assortment.  Round quarter size, sweet enough that you only need a few but not so sweet that you don't want more.  Not mild like milk chocolate, more like bitter-sweet chocolate chips type flavor or cocoa powder.  Except for the bizarre texture change, they were good and I ate them all over a few days.  There's not that many, they are small like the pineapple cookies but chocolatey enough that I couldn't just eat the little bag in one or two sittings.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy them quite as much two hours later when I went to have another two cookies because they had a chewy/stale texture-not chewy out of the oven, but chewy/stale/rubbery and even though they were folded over twice with the sides tucked in, clamped closed with a mini binder clip, and back in the closed box, the texture still morphed - that's just weird to me.  Next day out of a ziploc, still chewy but didn't get worse.  They were still an actual cookie and held together to be eaten like a cookie (well, it's bite-size so it's not like you're going to take a bite anyway, it's too small for that but it's not a pile of crumbs like the other two, but if they were a normal size cookie, they could be bitten into without losing the entire cookie.  Anyway, although it was totally weird, like nothing I've ever seen before, this morphing texture thing that is almost immediate, I still ate the rest of the Chocolate Mud Cookies.  But, I wouldn't buy them again.  They weren't good enough to ignore the texture thing and $5 a box for less than a nut bowl's worth of cookies (they are sold here-- 4 boxes, 3 oz each, same as this set for $19current price-$24 regular price)that's just a ridiculous price for the amount of product, especially considering the quality as a whole.  Sorry Paula Deen, the cookies in this set are just not quality products and 3 oz is much less than you could ever think.  Sadly, the one and only decent product that I would buy again from this sample is the Cheese Straws and it is THE ONLY PRODUCT IN THIS SET THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ITS OWN.  That's a shame because I would buy them today.",other

The olive paste is a little salty and strong, but so are the black olives from which it is made.  All of these taste very good and are excellent condiments to use on veggies and eggs as well as pasta.  My only complaint is that there is a little too much olive oil in each jar - I had put them on a slanted shelf in my refrigerator, and a lot of the oil leaked out (even when the tops were tightly screwed on).  Needless to say, I had a mess to clean up but learned that olive oil is excellent for dry skin!  I would definitely buy these again.  This is a good sampler.",great

Maybe if you've never had BBQ or good BBQ this might be passable but otherwise just think it over - pasta with BBQ sauce - and let that be your guide.<br /><br />For completeness, what really struck me wrong about it was the texture with the flavor. It was odd to say the least. Not inedible but weird in a bad way.<br /><br />If you like BBQ sauce and you are a big pasta fan then this probably is worth a try. Everyone else should avoid it.",other

A-lot of dry pastas these days have very little flavor, this stuff has tons. The texture is also great. These noodles are very ""toothsome"" they are chewy (in that great homemade sense of the word). One thing to watch out for is the packaging. As soon as you open the box, check the bags of pasta for holes. The stripes of pasta are so thick that their corners can punch through the plastic.

Too early overcooks and too soon results in cold spots. I dump the seasoning powder in a large zip lock bag and then toss the chicken in the seasoning. It makes for very tasty chicken. I also go beyond what the box calls for with the Kung Pao. I add some celery, onion and 1"" squares of green pepper. I also add a table spoon of red chili sauce to the mix for added spice.

398,B004AH7C2S,"First of all, I do buy this at my local supermarket because it is a little cheaper (even with tax). I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!",great

There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable.  I poured the mix out.  The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out.  I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first.  BIG MISTAKE!  I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund.

The powder is extremely chalky in texture (although this isn't necessarily to be unexpected with supplement powders), and has a taste that is truly unique (I can't quite convey what it tastes like, but even when mixed in with various foods, the potent flavor lingers and the food begins to taste like maca rather than concealing the flavor).  While I believe that the health benefits of the product are impressive, with a taste that makes it hard to consume enough to reap these benefits, it may be easier to get pills (or work really hard to find a recipe that conceals the maca flavor). The one things that seems to help diminish the flavor is putting it in the refrigerator (this is also the best way to preserve the maca as this is a large package of it and it would be a shame to see it spoil).",other

It isn't bitter at all, even after cold brewing for several days.  The package says it is gently roasted in small quantities.

Adding cream/milk and an occasional shot of flavored syrup helps mellow the taste and makes it more enjoyable, but I'm still not sure if I will drink all 4 packs.  If someone asks me ""Why is all the rum gone?"" I can now answer with great confidence:  in my coffee, of course.",other

510,B001SB96NW,"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime.  The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.",great

So i would not recommend this candy to anyone.",other

571,B001ET63NE,"I LOVE to grill!  And when I do, I'll grill any vegetable in the house that's not moving.  My only problem with grilled veggies is that there are seldom leftovers for the next day when I do this really simple, stupid recipe:<br /><br />Try those mini-sweet peppers, mushrooms, asparagus, onions, garlic, artichoke hearts, thinly sliced sweet potatoes, etc.  Slice/clean them to chunky stir-fry size.  Marinate them in olive oil and this amazing fig-balsamic vinegar glaze.  Grill them on a wok-for-the-grill -- saves skewering them (no matter how well you do it, they still fall off!).  Remove when done to your liking.  Then drizzle more of this glaze and then add salt and pepper to taste.  You will get raving reviews from your guests.  The problem is that once you put it on the plate (and I have a HUGE one), everything disappears before you, the grill-master, gets a chance to nibble some!  So keep aside what you want, THEN give the rest to your guests!<br /><br />I've done many meats grilled with this as a finishing glaze -- even moose and bear.  (Hey, I live in Alaska, and we have great road kill up here!)  I've even grilled ""chicken in foil"", a favorite of the pu-pu platter, and with only the addition of ginger and soy to the glaze, and I have a winner!!  I just have to make PLENTY of it.<br /><br />If you don't like any of the above recommendations, whine to me in any subsequent reviews.  I grilled all the above on charcoal, not gas, so there might be that missing element of smoky flavor, but I still get great results even with my George Foreman grill.",great

I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed.

596,B005F5DKMU,"I have been giving this oil to my 13-year old arthritic Siberian Husky for about 2 months now. He has been getting some type of fish oil for about a year. This oil has made the biggest and most noticeable difference in his mobility. With cheaper oils he improves but still needs occasional anti-inflammatories to keep him from limping and getting too stiff. With this oil he doesn't need the meds, and he has been moving easier and faster on our walks. He doesn't limp even after a 2-hour hike on hilly terrain.<br /><br />He also gets monthly Adequan shots - and it really seems to be the combination of the fish oil and the Adequan that keeps him moving at this level.

I try really hard to limit the amount of sugar in my diet, but also avoid artificial sweeteners at all costs (I'd rather just have the sugar). As soon as this arrived, I cracked open a can, poured it over ice into a glass & took a whiff. It smelled great--like a regular cola! It looked right--perfect color, lots of carbonation, etc. But that's as far as it went with the positives... as soon as I tasted it, I shuddered--literally. It tastes like an extra sweet version of Diet Pepsi (my most HATED soda, ever). The sweetness is sickening, tastes NOTHING like a sugar-type of sweetness, and leaves a really metallic taste in my mouth.

No blender required, though blending does make it frothy.<br /><br />It's a great emergency-preparedness item to have on hand.<br /><br />Tastes good, and even better if for some reason you haven't eaten and are famished.  If you have any insulin resistance going on, you will crash because of the high sugar content.  This is not great nutrition as with some of the protein powders, but with milk it suffices nicely.<br /><br />This is not a breakfast ""food"" per se, in my opinion.

654,B0040LMQ6Q,"Ronzoni Garden Delight Radiatore may be a more expensive pasta than others, but I think it's worth it.  Having a full serving of vegetables per 4 ounces of pasta makes it a healthier option than plain pasta.  Plus, the veggies add a bit of flavor to the pasta that changes things up a bit, in a good way.<br /><br />I like the radiatore shape for macarroni and cheese.  It makes a good base, with lots of crevaces to fill with cheese.  It feels heartier, too.<br /><br />You can taste the veggie powders used in this pasta.  To me, there is a flavor of mild tomato soup and mild vegetable broth, as though you've cooked the pasta in a concentrated vegetable broth.  I tastes pretty good, and actually makes the mac and cheese taste great!  Even my hubby liked it!<br /><br />Along with the vegetables, you also get fiber and protein with the pasta.  There's a good amount of Vitamin A, which usually isn't in pasta.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend at least trying Ronzoni Garden Delight in place of regular pasta in most any dish.  It adds a different flavor, but it isn't overpowering and blends into your meal.  Whether it's a hot or cold dish, using this radiatore in it makes it healthier and tasty.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br /><br />PROS:<br />- good flavor, can taste mild vegetable flavors<br />- cooks up well and easily<br />- provides extra nutrition regular pasta doesn't<br /><br />CONS:<br />- more expensive than regular pasta",great

659,B001FA1HYW,"The milk chocolate chunks in this product are heavenly.  The reason for the 3-star rating, whereas my other reviews of the Al Wadi halvas are higher, is primarily because of the inconsistency in the quality of the product from tub to tub in the same case, in the same shipment.  The first one I opened was amazing.  There were enormous globs of those wonderful chocolate chunks and the halva was soft, and resembled chocolate chip cookie dough in texture with this sweet, nutty taste that was to-die-for.  The next tub I opened was quite dry and although it had some good chunks in it, I found that I was basically digging out the chocolate and avoiding the halva, which was hard, dry and nearly tasteless.  The remaining tubs followed this trend.  I compared the halva in this product (just the halva) to the plain Al Wadi halva and it didn't taste nearly as good; it was also harder and drier and more compacted.  If I were rating on the halva alone in this particular iteration, I would have to give it 1 or 2 stars, but the stellar chocolate pieces really deserve some credit, so I settled on an overall rating of 3 stars.  I don't think that this type has as much benefit for breastfeeding mothers as the plain or pistachio types because of the large amount of chocolate which has been introduced to the product, and the benefit comes in the halawa extract which is in the halva and not the chocolate.  If you're looking to increase your breast milk production, get the plain or pistachio; however, I think the American palette would be more receptive to this, the halva with chocolate, IMHO.  Get some gas relief pills if you're going to be snacking on halva constantly for breast milk production (take it from me and save yourself the pain)!",other

662,B000MSFC9E,"JACOBS CRONAT GOLD INSTANT COFFEE makes an excellent cup of coffee!<br />ESPECIALLY if one likes a MILD cup of coffee.

However, if the water for this instant coffee is boiled LONG<br />enough, I find that a wonderful hint of strength is brought forth<br />amongst the mild taste, giving it a unique and delightful flavour,<br />which I have found, so far, in NO other instant coffee!<br /><br />  COFFEE....INSTANT....COFFEE<br /><br />The jar this coffee comes in is pleasing indeed!  Made of VERY heavy<br />glass,, I found that, (ordering four at a time to save on postage),<br />that the unopened package could easily be used as a doorstop!  The<br />""crown""-like cover is easy to open -- in a seemingly-circular, (but<br />actually fifteen-sided figure), design. Those 15 sides make it VERY<br />easy to open!<br /><br />On the two sides of the golden label, are printed directions for<br />use -- in NINE languages!  I can read the English, (UK) directions,<br />and recognize, (I think), the lettering for the Russian, (MK) -- or<br />is it Greek -- directions, though I cannot read them.  The other<br />directions -- for ""AL""; ""HR/BiH""; ""SRB..(Serbia?) / MNE""; and ""SI"",<br />are in languages I do not know.  It's fascinating to look at this<br />label, however -- because it confirms my suspicions that Americans<br />are woefully under-educated, as I, (who was educated in District 26<br />in Queens, New York -- reputedly one of the best public school<br />districts in New York City, and in Queens College of the City of<br />New York, (which also has a sterling reputation), could recognize<br />but two of these languages!  I also noted -- with some alarm -- that<br />FRENCH does NOT seem to be one of the nine languages used for these<br />directions!  Maybe it IS there, and I have had too many years pass<br />between college French classes and now....but if it ISN'T there, the<br />manufacturers of this coffee are MISSING a market which will NOT<br />accept ANY merchandise of ANY kind, without FRENCH instructions<br />being given on the packaging: QUEBEC, CANADA!  (This includes EVERY<br />imaginable  product: in the infamous ""Matzo-gate"" of several years<br />back, the government of Quebec would not even allow Matzo to be<br />imported into Quebec, for Jews celebrating Passover, because there<br />was NO FRENCH LETTERING on the boxes!)  This is all the more aston-<br />ishing to me, as it seems that the JACOBS Coffee Company has now<br />become a subsidiary of the KRAFT FOODS CORPORATION (!) -- a very<br />large food company, which should be aware of the Quebec law!  (Or<br />perhaps they are just too busy producing yummy food to have re-<br />membered this?)  Anyway, I happen to have relatives in Quebec --<br />so I KNOW this Quebec law -- of having FRENCH language directions<br />included on EVERYTHING, is true.  So, if KRAFT, and JACOBS, want<br />to sell this coffee to the Quebec, Canada market, I respectfully<br />request they include FRENCH directions on the packaging!<br /><br />Altogether, this is a delicious instant coffee -- especially if<br />you like MILD instant coffee.

691,B00520C3IU,"Most cat owners know the benefits of grass for their feline's digestive health.  Animals that are strictly indoor residents don't have easy access to grass, so it's up to their owners to supplement this need for their pets.  Most pet stores carry some type of 'ready to use' oat grass, however a combination of overwatering and artificial light in stores causes heavy mold growth at the base of the grass and on the root system, limiting life of the product and producing health concerns for both pet and owner.<br /><br />To avoid such issues, I've been in search of a good cat grass to grow at home.  After going through several other exceptionally poor products, I gave the Petlinks system a try.  The system comes enclosed within a round white plastic tub and contains everything you need to grow grass (container, soil, oat seed) except water.  The instructions are simple and clear, and allow individuals with 'brown-thumbs' to produce a lush, thick green product.<br /><br />The first step is to poke some small holes in the bottom of the container.  The product instructions indicate 4-6, however since I used a very small object (turkey skewer) to make the holes I ended up making ~15 holes across all areas of the container the bottom to allow for sufficient drainage. In the second step, you plant the seeds; the product instructions indicate you ""stir in the seeds, ensuring most are covered"".  If that is followed as stated, it could cause variability in the extent of your yield; while you may get sufficient growth, it probably wouldn't be optimal as it would be difficult to get sufficient soil coverage of the seeds.  A better idea is to remove about 1/4"" to 1/2"" of soil from the container (using a tablespoon) before sprinkling the seeds on the surface of the remaining soil in the container; lightly cover the seeds with the soil you removed to complete the planting process. By doing this, it ensures all the seeds are sufficiently covered and will grow to their maximum capacity.  The final steps are to place the container on a small saucer, water the soil with 1/4 cup water, loosely place the lid on the tub, and place the entire thing in a warm dark place (I used a kitchen cupboard).  Expect to see sprouts emerge in ~3 days (it will be quite evident as they push the lid up with their growth); once that happens just remove the lid, move the entire unit to a sunny location and keep the soil slightly moist.  You'll get full growth in ~7-10 days, though it will vary as some of the seed germinate faster than others.  This is actually a benefit as it makes the system more robust and provides a thick growth of the product due to the staggered sprouting.  Best of all, cats love it!  I've had to break up a couple fights between my two cats already over the first harvest.  :)  I've posted some photos of a 10-day growth (with a ruler included for scale) so you can judge the end result for yourself.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - Easy to use<br />  - Goof-proof instructions<br />  - Thick, healthy product that grows fast<br />  - Cats love it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - None",great

In fact, I really enjoyed all of the flavors with the exception of the Donut Shop Blend.  After trying it on two separate occasions, I finally ended up throwing out the rest of the Donut Blend pods because I didn't like the bitter taste.

The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.

It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",great

761,B005FU4XB2,"My dogs love these!  They are huge compared to other ""large"" antlers and much cheaper if you calculate the price per Oz of the other antlers I purchased at PetCo.<br /><br />I have an aggressive chewer ""10 yr old yellow lab"" and will go through a large rawhide bone in about an hour or an X-large ""everlasting dog treat"" in about 30 minutes.  I also have a moderate chewer ""2 yr old golden retrieve"" who goes through the rawhide and ""everlasting dog treat"" in about twice the time as the lab.<br /><br />Both of my dogs work on these antlers almost daily.  We purchased two of Newts Chews Antler ""Monster"" size back in August and it's now October.  One of the chews is half it's original length and the other is about three quarters of it's original length.  The dogs seem to only chew on one end or the other and wear it down from the end.  There have not been any pieces break off that can be swallowed and cause a bowel obstruction, unlike rawhide.  They don't get all  gooie (is that a word?) and smelly like other treats we have tried.  Our dogs are mostly indoors so we need something that is safe, non-staining, non-smelly, durable, and cost effective.

Some of the adult Purina canned foods have actual pieces of meat and rice that you can see (there is usually a picture of what it looks like on the back).

As the product description says, ""No pie we've ever tried came with the satisfying crunch and nutritional punch delivered by this energy bar."" That may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but the bar does taste good and does have a balanced set of natural ingredients.<br /><br />One observation is that each bar weighs in at 200 calories.

819,B004ZXYK6I,"I love Devil Dogs. Unfortunately, here in the Seattle area they are not for sale. For the last few years I have odered them online. The product you are viewing is sold by an affiliate merchant with Amazon. Shipping is done by the seller. I wouldn't be surprised if the seller buys the Devil Dogs at a local supermarket, boxes them, and ships. In terms of the product itself, well Devil Dogs are really wonderful. This review is more about buying them than extolling their value as a treat.<br /><br />The first thing to know is that Drakes Cakes short dates Devil Dogs. They have an expiration date less than a month after manufacture. This is their way of assuring freshness. Expect the product you receive from this vendor to have a week or less of time before the ""sell before"" date. This is not a problem. As long as you get them before the sell-by date, you will be fine. One really nice thing about this product is that you can safely freeze them in their package. I just open the carton, unpack, the retail packs and put them in the freezer. I then pull them out one box at a time as needed. They don't get stale that way and the taste does not change due to freezing.<br /><br />As far as this seller goes, shipping is pompt. In this case they came in a Priority Mail package. No damage of any kind. My one complaint is the shipping cost. As I recall it is nearly $8 per order of 6. Now that isn't too bad all things considered. What did bother me is that when I priced a double order (12 retail packs), the shipping price doubled! There is no savings if you order more. What this means to me is that I will only order 6 boxes at a time. So, if you figure the cost: $26 for the product and $8 for shipping, you are paying $34, which turns out to be about 71 cents each. Well worth it to me.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great treat, fairly priced, and promptly shipped. A good deal all around.",great

Without the promo price it would cost more that I'm willing to pay.",great

838,B000EVPAXC,"First off these ""gummi"" apples don't have the gummi consistancy that haribo's other gummi candies have. They were so soft that they were like eating gum drops instead of a gummi product. I know what you are thinking, they were probably just really really fresh. No that wasn't it. I have purchased (and enjoyed) the haribo gummi sour cherries and they were very fresh when I received them but they still had the gummi texture that I was looking for. I had someone else try the candy just to see if they agreed with me and they said the same thing I do, that these aren't anything like gummies. I don't know... maybe I got a bag from some weird mutant batch and maybe they aren't always like this. Who knows.<br /><br />The second thing is that the flavor is a bizarre apple-ish flavor that was not enjoyable in the least. It had kind of a chemical taste to it.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend this product. Try the sour cherry, it is much, much better.",other

845,B0030VBPN2,"This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it.[...] Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website.  [...]) Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm197570.htm). In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.",great

855,B002O0I3I0,"Acid is, oddly, the most benign of flavor amplifiers.  Think about it.  Sugar? Salt? Alcohol? Fat?  I do not mean in any way to be a food fear monger. I merely point out that first glance, acid seems more menacing than any of those.  For kitchen magic, acid rules mine.  A splash of lime, coffee in my red-eye gravy, all those wonderful vinegars are lining my shelf.<br /><br />Now the resurgence of an ancient and feisty acid, verjuice.  It has largely been neglected outside of wine country.  Most of mine comes from odd places in Bordeaux.  But you can get this fine find from Fallot, a most reliable maker from Burgundy.  You may know their fine mustards.  This is one verjuice which you may confidently measure others against.  Why?<br /><br />Verjuice had not had modern marketing to spread its unique quality and flavor.  Sour grapes, you say? Exactly.  What do you do when the weather is so crumby that the grapes are not sweet enough for wine?  A good excuse to press verjuice.<br /><br />Now for the bad news.  Verjuice is in resurgence.  As with all things rediscovered, many are busy ""helping"" its image with a facelift.  Culinary botox.  From California to Australia, everybody is getting into the act; thin or flabby faux verjuice is hitting the shelves.  All cute and flouncy, it has not the backbone and courage to do the heavy lifting in the kitchen.  You might as well pour lemonade over your grilled salmon.<br /><br />But here is the acidic glory.  Taste it alone.  Now you can compare anything you might run across.  Some vineyards make the veritable verjuice.  Next, try poaching gently some fresh and really ripe fruit.  It loves to be swirled into your beurre blanc.  Whip some into your best cream.  Deglaze the roasting pan for some old time gravy.  Nutmeg and a nice five pepper blend (don't forget the allspice) are all you need for your steamed vegetables.  ""What did you do?""  And you can tell the truth.",great

862,B004SIKU4G,I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason.

868,B002EZHSN6,"This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two.

870,B0037B0A7M,"I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.",great

The pakora (traditionally, a fried dumpling of gram (say, chickpea)) flour are too few... except for the 2nd problem, that they aren't very good. So - less is better? Anyway, over 2/3 of the pouch was sauce. But, I don't think anyone will feel slighted by less of *these* pakora.

911,B000BJIWK0,"This pasta is hot enough that with an appropriate sauce, such as a Thai peanut sauce, it's hard to stop eating.  I add fried sweet potatoes and garden serranos.  Sort of like a moderately hot salsa, there's an instinct to just keep eating it.  It isn't so hot that it is unpleasant to eat and it doesn't have any chili flavor of its own.<br /><br />You can eat it with a marinara and I do, seasoning it with red pepper flakes.  I'm not a heat freak by any stretch and neither are my dinner guests, but the kick is a welcome alternative and the foundation for many great dishes.  This also goes well with an alfredo or other cream sauce.  I wouldn't recommend it for something Mediterranean styled full of delicate flavors such as capers and olive oil.  Whether it goes well with pesto or is sort of a waste of pesto is debatable.  It's a great base to Indian dishes with goat cheese and lots of fresh vegetables like squashes, zucchini, cauliflower, and so on.<br /><br />Rossi Pasta's website has this same size at the same price.  (I keep trying to order on it, but it makes you recover the password for the account you didn't want to create each time and then still can't process the order.  It might be one of those ""it only works with IE"" deals that works for most people, but just barely.)<br /><br />As long as I'm griping, I'd like to see a bit better price on this bulk size.  $5/pound is pretty steep for pasta.

They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.""<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes.

974,B001E5E0IS,"I use mate with black tea to get an extra dose of caffeine in the morning. That way my brew is not bitter and it packs a punch. This mate is the best I have had. It is fresh smelling and tasting, and it has a lot of flavor in the cup. Most mates are more in the background of the black tea in my concoction. This mate is front and center. I really enjoy it.<br /><br />On top of all that, it is not expensive. In fact, for its quality it is quite a bargain. I hope I can continue to get this product at this price.<br /><br />I have a gourd and I have used it once or twice.<br /><br />My preferred method is to use three cups of water to two teaspoons of tea and two of mate. I cool the water for 60 to 70 seconds before pouring it over the mixed tea and mate. I'm not a purist, but I get something I like and can drink on a consistent basis. It makes a good amount of liquor and it is mild to the palate and gives a good dose of caffeine.<br /><br />For tea, I use PG Tips Loose Tea.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/B001EQ5JJQ"">PG Tips Black Tea, Loose Tea, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>",great
975,B001HTN3XO,I didn't know what to expect this tea to taste like and wow!!  It's a bit sour and I wondered what to do with the rest of the case I purchased.  After drinking about half the bottle I really started to like this.  I think a cold bottle of Kombucha is great to sip on a hot day.  I would buy this again for sure.,great

It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor.",great

The results from each test was the same.<br /><br />I would not suggest this version of the product, other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries.",other

985,B001E4S8GO,"Skippy Natural is good, but I prefer Teddie Natural because it tastes more like natural, freshly ground, peanut butter. I bought the Skippy because it was a good price and it's a bit easier because you don't need to stir it when you first open it. The oil in Teddie Natural separates and floats on top, but once mixed and refrigerated it stays mixed pretty well. I also like the Skippy because it doesn't require refrigeration, so I can keep it in my desk at work for a quick snack.",other

990,B00284QDC0,Well here goes--yes it was good to find this creamer on amazon BUT instead of coming in the dispenser box they came fired in a shipping box. One or more them had leaked which made kind of a mess.  It would have been nice if these little containers were in a dispenser box INSTEAD  of being fired in a shipping box.  I hate with a passion cleaning up sticky things. At least only a couple of them leaked but that is still unacceptable.,other
991,B006FC4256,"Addendum to my review...  I left my original review unedited below.  I edited my star rating at behest of my wife.  She really liked Dr. Flynn's granola, but did not think it was the ""best ever.""  However, considering she is a granola lover too, I cannot discount her powerful opinion.  We sat down and had a taste test with various granolas.  I concede that Dr. Flynn's can hold its own in any comparison, but it certainly does not distance itself either; it is within the peloton.  I also concede that my original scathing review was the result of inflated expectations based on the existing glowing reviews.  We are unsure if we would purchase this again.  Our overall favorite remains Nature's Path.<br /><br />Ok.  My wife got me addicted to Natures Path Hemp granola and their pumpkin seed granola about seven years ago.  Those cereals are so good I crave them, and I never liked granola before.  We had been buying the Natures Path granola at local grocers and kept getting stuck in the eye, so I was happy to see that I could get orders of six at a time through Amazon for a good price.  I was recently re-ordering the granola when I noticed that Dr. Flynn's Organic granola was actually rated higher, by reviewers, than the Natures Path that I love so dearly.  How could that be possible, I thought, so I ordered three bags of the stuff to try it out.<br />Wow, was I surprised!  There are things on this good Earth that are inherent truths that cannot be seen otherwise.  Baby hugs and kisses are wonderful things.  Murder is bad.  Natures Path granola is absolutely delicious.  These statements cannot be effectively argued against.  Dr. Flynn's granola, however, is no where near being a universal good.  I would rate it no better than what a reasonable home chef could prepare on the fly.  It is essentially just rolled oats, nuts, raisins, coconut, sugar, and some cinnamon.<br />I sincerely believe that there is no way that all of those glowing reviews are real, as I do not believe that such a high percentage of people could have mistaken Dr. Flynns granola for a 5 star product.  It tastes like granola.  Below average granola.<br />If you must find out for yourself, I strongly recommend you try one bag instead of my three.  I got burned.",other

After few emails with dismissive statements like :""the chocolates are still good for several months after the sell by expiration dates"", I decided to accept 50% discount. I have suspicion that this was not a innocent mistake, because the bottoms of all 10 packages look like rubbed off so that the expiration dates were very faint. I was not happy with how the matter was handled and did not appreciate the attitude of representative, which I did expressed in my ""Sellers feedback"". Today I received 2 PHONE CALLS - first to me, but after I refused to discuss anything by phone, my husband , who picked up second call minutes later (which I see as harassment !!!), had to listen the threat that if i would not remove my review, they will set the lawyer on me !!!

I was skeptical when buying this from Amazon because it was so much cheaper than other calendars on this site, but boy was i wrong - this could be the same calendar I got as a kid! This is a real German calendar with real German chocolate and an old-timey hand-drawn Christmas scene (it's just printed of course, I don't mean someone drew each box!).
