1,-1E+131,negative numbers are allowed?
2,-1E+37,lowest minimum integer
3,"-999,999,999,999,999,000,000,000,000",No idea
4,-1E+21,is this even allowed???
5,-9999999999,whole positive numbers and their opposites
6,0,0 is the lowest possible integer that is not negative.
7,0,It is not negative.
8,0,Its the first one that isn't negative
9,0,"I simply want to watch the world burn as math geeks fight over whether zero is a positive integer or not. We can all agree it is a non-negative integer, but these pesky directions opted for ""positive integer"". Perhaps this will settle the debate and cement my place in math history."
10,0,"0 is the lowest positive integer number. People will probably try to avoid numbers they think everyone will pick, might as well pick the lowest."
11,0,"Positive zero is the smallest positive integer, but just tricky enough that no one else will guess it."
12,0,Low interger
13,0,I figured everyone would assume be the most common choice and decide to choose something in the 20s. I also remember from math class that 0 is a positive number.
14,0,A whole number that does not have a decimal or fractional part
15,0,"Zero is the lowest positive integer, but many people don't think of it."
16,0,"figure my best chance is that moderator treats 0 as acceptable, but most submitters do not."
17,0,People may not think it's positive
18,0,I hope no one else thinks about that one ^^
19,0,Lowest possible integer?
20,0,Cuz copy and paste is a thing :)
21,0,Smallest positive integer
22,0,Fuck it.
23,0.001,Low number to the right of zero
24,1,Someone (probably lots of someones) had to pick it
25,1,d
26,1,Lowest positive integer.  Fingers crossed everybody else thinks it's too obvious and doesn't meet second criteria
27,1,"Crossing my fingers that everyone else will think 1 is a bad idea. But given the sheer number of entries you'll probably get, it's more likely that a few of them have the same rationale."
28,1,Maybe no one else will be this clever....
29,1,go big or go home babyyyyyy
30,1,It's a risk but one I'm willing to take
31,1,somebody's got to do it....
32,1,"Eh, maybe enough people will think its too obvious and not pick it.  Or I run into others picking it and I should do 2.  Probably 9."
33,1,Someone's gotta try it.
34,1,"Because it makes no difference which number I choose. I'm at the mercy of chance that someone else chooses the same number, so why not go for the lowest possible integer which most people will ignore because it's too obvious an answer as they assume everyone else will choose it as well?"
35,1,"Mostly a spoiler. I assume I wont be the only one to choose 1, but if everyone has that mindset maybe I will!"
36,1,"Just in case everyone else assumes no one would be dumb enough to put in 1--here I am, just dumb enough."
37,1,"Hey, it was the lowest number available, I'll take my chances everyone else overthinks it"
38,1,"I figured everyone else thought lots of people would select one, so I did, hoping that I would be the only one to do so.  I doubt it, but we will see."
39,1,Because I'm betting on the long shot that noone else is dumb enough to choose 1
40,1,I don't think anyone else has the balls to go this low
41,1,What if no one else picks it?
42,1,"Because if the person who wins wins by choosing the number 1, we are all going to hate the person. This ensures that this will be prevented or that I will be the person who is hated.

Also, this is not a new idea. The puzzle website Nikoli has been doing this for over a decade, it's called the Nikoli Derby."
43,1,"This is a high-risk, high-reward choice. It's possible that everybody will assume that somebody will enter 1, and therefore it can't win, and try something higher. It's unlikely that nobody else will try this, but if nobody does, I win."
44,1,I'm a high-school math teacher and have played this game with students.  It's surprising how many times 1 wins.
45,1,because someone has to
46,1,Trying the obvious
47,1,Maybe I'm the only one stupid enough to pick this number.
48,1,"I am taking the reverse psychology scattergories approach. In the board game scattergories there are multiple categories that require a unique answer In order to earn a point. In this game, you obviously want to come up with an answer that no one else came up with, so everyone avoids the obvious answer. More often than not, the most obvious answer is never given. So, if you had used the easy answer, then you would still be earning a point. That's why I'm going with the most obvious, easy answer, in hopes that everyone else is ""too smart"" to submit it too."
49,1,Someone has to.
50,1,"if no one else picks it, its the winner."
51,1,"I am assuming every one else will think that if they choose 1, then it won't be unique, so they will choose a number greater than 1.  That leaves 1 for me!!!!"
52,1,Just in case someone else doesn't guess 1
53,1,"An integer is a ""counting number"" i.e. No fractions or decimals are in integers, zero is neither positive nor negative which leaves 1 as the next lowest integer"
54,1,"No one else would be so stupid to pick the lowest number, that everyone else will pick."
55,1,Guessed no one else would be bold enough to choose the lowest number
56,1,Just doing my part making sure #1 is accounted for!
57,1,"I've done with this classes of 30, generally the 1 gambit seems to be the best choice."
58,1,It's the lowest
59,1,Worth a shot.  Maybe nobody else goes that low.
60,1,gotta go low
61,1,Everyone may assume that this is taken.
62,1,Can anybody be dumb enough to pick 1?
63,1,"I thought it would be really funny if every single person overthought it, and no one chose 1."
64,1,Because wouldn't it be funny if it ends up being 1?
65,1,Just in case everyone else outthinks themselves and no one else takes the lowest possible positive integer!
66,1,Just in case
67,1,"Worth a try, right?"
68,1,Maybe I'll get lucky and everyone else will overthink it
69,1,Maybe everyone else will overthink this and I'll get really lucky.
70,1,It's the most optimal choice from a game theory perspective. It is the only possible number that wins assuming it is unique. If I had a second guess (I assume most of your readers know game theory and some will implement it as rigidly as I have) I'd say 6
71,1,I want to make sure no one else can win with this number
72,1,Maybe everyone will decide it's too obvious? Also zero isn't positive.
73,1,Somebody has to
74,1,"No one is actually going to pick 1, right?"
75,1,I think there's a high enough chance that no one else picks 1.
76,1,I'm hoping no one else was foolhardy enough to go for the easy win.
77,1,"This is simply an investment in the glory of being the only person to guess ""1""."
78,1,"It is the lowest possible positive integer, however as such, one could assume then that it would be chosen frequently and thus not unique. However, also assuming that people have this realization, would mean they would not pick 1 in which case the odds it is unique is much higher. This is why I have chosen 1."
79,1,"Triple reverse psychology.  Everyone will want to submit it, so everyone will think they cannot. Knowing this, a few will think others won't submit it, and will again be tempted.  But they will think a few will submit it, so they will back off a second time.  So I am submitting it, hoping everyone else thinks it will be picked by someone else, and avoid it."
80,1,Most people are going to assume low integers will get chosen and choose a higher number.
81,1,1 is an integer
82,1,because wouldn't it be awesome
83,1,I'm hopeful everyone will think no one will pick one.
84,1,Here's hoping literally everyone else is a hipster and assumes they need to go for a higher number!
85,1,"It's unlikely this will be unique, but if everyone else thinks that way, then this will win"
86,1,"I'm counting on everyone else being too clever to pick 1 --- ""go small or go home"""
87,1,There is a good chance that no one dares to pick 1.
88,1,Let's see if anyone else has the guts to do it...  :)
89,1,Who would choose the obvious answer?
90,1,"I'm not going to win, but I'm making sure somebody else who thinks they're clever doesn't."
91,1,"Eh, might as well try."
92,1,"It is the lowest positive integer, and maybe no one else will pick it."
93,1,Just in case
94,1,Lowest positive integer
95,1,Why not?
96,1,Just a test to see if I can spam with a separate email.
97,1,"1 is the lowest positive integer.  Since it needs to be the lowest unique integer, I'm assuming that everyone will consider 1 to be too obvious a choice and hence unlikely to be unique.  Much like my strategy would be on The Price Is Right, I'll bet $1, Bob."
98,1,May be overlooked
99,1,It's a super long shot but I'm hoping everyone just over thinks this and assumes that the lowest positive integer will be picked many times.
100,1,"Well, it's definitely the lowest.  My hope is that everyone else is convinced that someone will pick 1 so they all move on to other numbers."
101,1,risk vs reward
102,1,On the off chance...
103,1,Moxie
104,1,a
105,1,It's a lowest positive integer there is. I hope no one else realises this.
106,1,Who would choose 1?
107,1,Hoping others overthink it and I get lucky.
108,1,Get em all
109,1,just in case no one else picks it
110,1,worth a try ;)
111,1,I'm guessing that no one else is going to pick the smallest positive integer because it's too obvious.
112,1,"An integer can only be a whole number, and since it has to be positive, the smallest number is one."
113,1,"I am kind of just hoping everyone who responds overthinks this. Seems unlikely, and I probably should have gone with 31."
114,1,"I am going on the basis that nobody will pick 1, assuming everyone will pick one and it won't be unique. So I am hoping I am the only person picking 1."
115,1,I would feel really stupid if somebody else won with one.
116,1,Want to make sure that someone provides the lowest possible response.
117,1,i looked it up.
118,1,"1 is a terrible pick, but everyone knows that and might avoid it."
119,1,"Clearly 1 is the lowest positive integer.  Thus no other number can beat it and 1 should be the most popular submission.  Because the goal is to submit a unique integer, only a fool would submit 1.  There are no fools in Riddler Nation,  so no one will submit 1.  Therefore, I will submit 1."
120,1,The extremely small chance no one else choose it.
121,1,"Because if I can't have it, nobody can. :)"
122,1,Just in case nobody else bothered to try it.
123,1,most people would assume that low numbers would be taken and therefor pick higher numbers to try to avoid competition.
124,1,1 is the smallest positive integer
125,1,23-22=1 (joke)
126,1,One. Just in case.
127,1,Someone has to.
128,1,"1,  2,  3, 4..."
129,1,On the off chance that everyone else in the world will decide that 1 can't possibly win.
130,1,My thinking is that the readers will overthink this one big time.
131,1,I mean it's not gonna win but it should help round out the dataset
132,1,An integer is a positive or negative whole number. The lowest positive integer is 1 (0 is neither positive or negative).
133,1,I'd hate to lose to somebody who picked 1.
134,1,Why not
135,1,"To be contrarian, I wouldn't normally pick the lowest option but who would really, so maybe my crazy idea will work."
136,1,assumes everybody else wants to be clever
137,1,"Theres a chance this could work. If everyone else assumes that no one would be silly enough to choose 1, and instead go with slightly higher numbers, its possible that 1 could be unique."
138,1,1 is a unique number -- there is no other number like it!
139,1,"Just to make sure nobody else wins with 1. If I win, great!"
140,1,N
141,1,Figured everyone else might not choose one and try and overthink it
142,1,I figured people were more likely to chose a number greater than 1 as they would believe someone else would be stupid enough to pick it. I am that person.
143,1,"I read ""The Emperor Has No Clothes"" to my nephew the other day so it seems like this is worth a shot."
144,1,Because no one will pick 1
145,1,I figure why not go with the lowest integer in the hopes that everyone else will assume someone will submit it.
146,1,The positive integer numbers are all the integer numbers to the right of zero in a number line. The lowest of them is 1.
147,1,1 is really low
148,1,lowest possible positive integer - taking my chances that no one else is submitting this lmao
149,1,NO reason.
150,1,Everybody thinks someone else will submit this number. I am someone else.
151,1,Just in case no one picks it
152,1,It's the lowest positive integer. I hope nobody else picks it.
153,1,"There are two possibilities here:

A: Everyone else is too afraid to pick the number 1 because they believe someone else will. In that case, I win.

B: Someone else has the same idea, but I ruin their day. In that case, I win... in a different way."
154,1,Somebody had to.
155,1,The unparalleled sense of smugness I will feel if I'm the only one.
156,1,"Seems that most people may overthink this one and perhaps I’ll squeeze in as the lone number one. Unlikely, but I’ll try it!"
157,1,Would feel silly if 1 was the winner and we did not select it
158,1,"It's unique because it's neither prime nor composite. There are no lower positive integers at all, so this is the smallest possible positive integer that is in some way unique."
159,1,It is the lowest positive integer.
160,1,?
161,1,Someone's got to pick one!
162,1,Felt like maybe no one else would be this brazen.
163,1,"I have no expectation of ""1"" being unique.  I'm simply ensuring that nobody manages to win with it by the ""too obvious"" argument.  It's unclear what the sample size is here, but if it's small enough, that terrible strategy could succeed."
164,1,"People may not choose 1, as it would be too obvious. I'm basically betting that everyone else will try to get too ""clever"" with their choices."
165,1,No one will choose it because they think everyone will choose it
166,1,i
167,1,"Just on the outside chance that everyone else will stay away from this ""obvious"" choice. Any other number will also have a low probability of success."
168,1,I think everyone else will try to be fancy and pick slightly higher numbers thinking everyone will be picking really low numbers.
169,1,Who else would pick 1? That's a ridiculous number to pick!
170,1,To stop anyone else submitting  the lowest integer and winning
171,1,"My answer has to satisfy two criteria, lowest number and unique number.  While the chance of it satisfying the unique number is low, it does not seem substantially lower than any other number, and has the advantage of being assured of being the lower possible possible integer, meaning that I start with a baseline of satisfying 50% of the criteria."
172,1,"Because I'll feel stupid of no one else enters it. 2 will probably win, though."
173,1,Hoping for luck
174,1,"Prisoner's dilemma sort of problem.  By going for the lowest positive integer I'm gambling that all other players will bet that at least two players will pick it, making it non unique.  If all players make this calculation then no-one will chose 1 and I'll win."
175,1,"Honestly trying to decide between 1, 4, and 8. Most people will try to outsmart, so maybe no one picks 1. Otherwise, 4 and 8 are the least common low integers."
176,1,I chose 1 because I think others will not choose it thinking everyone else might choose it.
177,1,This type of challenge seems extremely vulnerable to answer spamming. I don't know if there is a good approach for honest submissions.
178,1,What if no one else does?
179,1,I'm calling everyone's bluff
180,1,No one will think of this
181,1,"I assume this will fail, but i wanted to see if people would overthink it and go for something higher."
182,2,because everyone else will enter '1'
183,2,"I was tempted to go big and enter '1', just in case everyone else psyched themselves out.  But if that was tempting to me, it'll be tempting for some other players.  How many?  I guess at least two ..."
184,2,"2 is too low, there's no way it could end up being unique, therefore no one will bother guessing it, so maybe it actually will end up being unique."
185,2,It's small
186,2,Just in case
187,2,Can't let anyone win with 2 because no one thinks to pick it.
188,2,"Most people would not think to choose the number 1. This would create an opening for few to choose that number, with the possibility of it being the lowest unique number. Someone may anticipate that logic by choosing the number 2. I am going to be that person."
189,2,sportz
190,2,"So most folks will avoid super low numbers and aim for numbers with at least double digits. The next group of people will realize that people will avoid super low integers and go with 1. They think they're clever. Unfortunately, there are probably multiple people thinking this way, so they just played themselves. I fall into the final group who chose the smallest integer that isn't 1. Hopefully it's not a group though. It's just me (again, hopefully)."
191,2,"Well I know that somebody else is inevitably going to pick 1, don't I?"
192,2,"I think they would be only two types of people: 1) One who would over think it and give bigger number and 2) One who goes ""Screw it. Go for number 1!""

I'm confident there is at least 2 people who are type-2"
193,2,It should be obvious based on the number that it is.
194,2,It's not 1
195,2,"Most people will use their submission to try to guess about when their answer will be unique (somewhere from 10-1000+). Some others will submit 1 as the default lowest positive integer. By choosing 2, I'm trying to sneak in between these two groups."
196,2,"It seems likely that a very small number won't win because multiple people will guess it, but that means other users will avoid the small numbers and one of them might actually win. But I won't guess 1 because at least a few smartasses are likely to guess that anyway."
197,2,my son picked it. And based on the way people approach these problems it probably isn't a bad choice v
198,2,Can't have someone winning this competition with just a 2.
199,2,2
200,2,Let's choose a number that no one else would submit because everyone else is looking for a totally oddball number.
201,2,I assume that someone is submitting 1.
202,2,"I chose Two, ""2"" because it is the lowest positive integer which is not 1. My first instinct was to pick a number in the 1000s range at random because I surmised that all the low numbers would be taken. However the other players in the ""game"" would likely make the same decision so I decided to choose a low number and hope that it would be unique and lower than the ""instinct"" population. Then I guessed that there would also be a ""clever"" population of people that would take the same route I had chosen and pick number one - 1. Therefore to avoid the ""instinct"" and ""clever"" populations I have chosen the number two - 2."
203,2,Several people will try to sneak the quick 1 in there - but after that who'd pick 2?  Seems like the number I would least want to select.  Ergo: my pick.
204,2,"I'm assuming some people will choose one, but of the people who don't choose one, they will all pick something significantly more than one."
205,2,"Someone will put 1, others will try to think of a number people won't think of, and my thought is it will be higher than 2"
206,2,People will assume that low numbers won't work so they will pick higher numbers. People that pick low because of this thinking will pick 1.
207,2,2 is an integer
208,2,Randomly drawn from an exponential distribution
209,2,Second test to see if its possible to spam guesses.
210,2,Everyone else who chooses a low number will choose 1.
211,2,Taking the route of hoping that other choose to go for larger numbers in belief that all the smaller numbers are all chosen. Stayed away from 1 as ut probably will be spammed.
212,2,a
213,2,Lots of people not paying attention to the instructions could choose 1
214,2,get em all
215,2,Likely that someone will pick the number 1 and instinct for unique number is high so going against the odds
216,2,"Hopefully everyone assumes the lowest numbers will be taken, and choose higher numbers. Somebody else may think like I do and pick 1. Terrible logic probably but cheers!"
217,2,It's the smallest number larger than 1.
218,2,Guessing
219,2,"I assumed that everyone else playing would themselves assume that a lot of the low numbers would be taken. I then thought I could be a lone person to actually put ""1,"" which others might avoid for being too obvious. However between the possibility that other people followed my exact logic, and the possibility that some would submit while misunderstanding the question, I chose the next lowest positive integer: 2."
220,2,I just thought that no one else would pick it since they would assume it was already chosen.
221,2,"I wanted to choose 1 and hope no one else would be that bad at this game. Then I got worried that other people would be that bad at this game so I chose 2. Watch, now it will turn out that no one chose 1 and several chose 2."
222,2,"My logic is that if there are 81 registered riddlers who all have experience on this site and trying to ""out-predict"" other people there is likely someone who thinks that one won't be put because it's too predictable but I would like to predict that multiple people think one will go unused so here I am using two in hopes that no other soul out there out-predicts my out-predictions."
223,2,figured everybody would say 1 so i took the next lowest. price is right style
224,2,Most people will think 1 is clever or pick a random larger number hoping no one else picks it
225,2,It's too much of an obvious number that maybe no one else will pick it!
226,2,"A lot of people will choose 1 to mess with it, but will forsake 2 for the same reason."
227,2,Somebody had to submit it
228,2,I figured no one would pick a really low number.  I didn't pick 1 because others would probably use the same logic and therefore pick the lowest number possible.
229,2,"I figure most people will choose higher numbers, and a few clever fellows will choose 1 and hope for the best, so I guess I'm choosing 2 and hoping no one thinks of that?"
230,2,"I remember seeing this question in Uni once, 25 years ago. A bunch of people submitted 1, 3 was popular as well, but no-one submitted 2. So I'm picking 2."
231,2,"I didn't think this through too hard. I figure people will put 1 expecting no one else to, so I'll choose 2 hoping no one else picked it. Otherwise it's just a guessing game, and I'm afraid of guessing too high."
232,2,Using findings from World Scientific Article: http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/publications/FNL_zeng2007.pdf
233,2,Seems like there will be at least one person who will just throw out 1 hoping no one else does.  I'll try a little higher (but I fear recursive reasoning will rule me out too).
234,2,Funsies
235,2,no one will guess it - expecting others to have done so
236,2,"im guessing most people wont choose a small number at the risk of it being non-unique. those who do will hopefully hedge all their bets and pick extremely low, (1), and im hoping no one will pick 2."
237,3,Premonition
238,3,"I figure a lot of people will go with 1 hoping that no one else does, a bunch will go with 2 thinking they might be the only one, and then everyone else will pick arbitrarily higher numbers (as I'm about to do with a 2nd submission)."
239,3,3
240,3,"The higher you go the better chance of being unique, but the worse chance of winning. 3 is probably too low."
241,3,It's lower than 4.
242,3,It's lower than 4.
243,3,"Well you said UNIQUE and I figured 1 would be taken, therefore, 3."
244,3,It seemed that 1 and 2 would be popular choices
245,3,"A bunch of people will choose 1 assuming that everyone else will overthink it (they wont)
A bunch of people will choose 2 trying to outsmart the 1s (They Won'T)
3 will take it (actually it won't...but oh well)"
246,3,"some will submit 1, thinking that no one else will bother; some will submit 2, having realized that some will submit 1.  I'm betting on the slim chance that no one besides me will think to submit 3.  Or that those who think it through that far will skip 3 and go to 4 or higher."
247,3,"Most people thinking rationally will probably choose a number that's moderately high, to decrease the chances of another person picking it. If we assume that most people reason as such, then a lower number will actually have a higher chance of being the winner. 1 will probably not be unique, since a number of people could reason this far. 2 might not be unique, since a number of people could reason this far. This logic could continue indefinitely, the stopping point is based loosely on how many people are likely to see and respond to the riddle and go through the aforementioned reasoning, a number whose magnitude I estimated from the amount of people commenting on the Healthcare debate liveblog (thus an estimate of the amount of people who frequent FiveThirtyEight). I'd be very interested to see this experiment conducted many times over differing crowd sizes and see if, as I suspect, the winning number is positively correlated to amount of participants."
248,3,I assume most people will assume that low numbers are too obvious. I spent a lot of time thinking about bigger numbers and then second guessed myself and here I am.
249,3,Because 3...is a magic number
250,3,Seems reasonable
251,3,"Some may go for the win with 1, others may assume them with 2, 3 is still high risk high reward but less risk than the other 2"
252,3,3 is an integer
253,3,"Lots of people will pick one.  Some people will try to pick 2 just to outsmart those people.  I am going to outsmart the smarts.  A lot of people will try to pick very high numbers, assuming that low numbers will be duplicated."
254,3,"Why not? Go big, but not really..."
255,3,Someone will pick 1 and 2 hoping all other pick random higher number.  Probably 3 as well but who knows.
256,3,No real reason
257,3,a
258,3,get em all
259,3,-
260,3,"There are two people that will try to solve this problem. Those that choose very low numbers gambling that no one else will, and those that try to choose the lowest high number that others would not have taken. As 2nd place has no value in a competition like this, I feel the correct way to maximize your results is to  choose the first method. However, I slightly hedge because someone had to choose 1 and 2... right? Maybe, or something?"
261,3,"1 is the obvious answer if there were only one submission... but I assume the website has more readers than just myself. Again, assuming most people will realize similarly and pick >30 again assuming the lower numbers have already been chosen by others... But what happens when everyone thinks the same thing and skips the numbers under 10. Okay, it's not 3 but I'm not a game theory expert."
262,3,Guessing
263,3,it would have been nice to know the approximate number of people likely to participate.  I first thought of choosing 1 thinking that nobody would be so bold as to try it.  But since it was my first thought I scrapped the idea.  Next I thought someone thinking along those lines might inch up to 2 to avoid the 1's.  Then I decided that people not trying super low answers might just skip over 3 and go higher.
264,3,Because why not?
265,3,"I figured most people would pick double digit numbers, but someone would pick one.  Then someone else would think that and pick 2.  I hope nobody thinks two steps ahead and pick 3."
266,3,Figured many people would have picked 1 thinking that most others would go high. So I went just above 1
267,3,I'm just doing my part to make sure people who submit really small numbers don't win.
268,3,"My wife said 2, I said 4; I averaged them. Guaranteed to work"
269,3,"It's low, but not too low"
270,4,"I expect a number of people to say 1-3, but 4 is viewed as more obscure"
271,4,"Everyone picks one, everyone who thinks that picks two. Three has got to be someone's favorite number, but no one likes 4"
272,4,"Because its a low number that doesn't seem to publicized. I think there will a couple of 1's ""just in case"" and then some two's and three's for about the same reason and because their low primes people will think of. 5 and 7 are also numbers that pop into mind quickly. I rarely think of the number 4 so I assume other people also rarely think of it."
273,4,"Many people, thinking the number must be unique, would probably choose a smallish number, probably two digits. Others, thinking further, might decide to pick the number 1 in the hope that nobody else would think of doing so. In the end, I decided on 4 as I thought it sounded not random enough to be picked by others."
274,4,"Trolls will select 1, reasonable people might pick 2 or 3. 4 is a number that maybe a lot of people will forget about? (Poor 4)"
275,4,who knows
276,4,The winning integer will be lower than most expect.
277,4,Seems more psychological than anything else.
278,4,"I figure people are going to overall avoid low numbers, since they will guess that it won't be unique in a competition to pick a low number. This will create an opportunity for a low number to win. On the flip side, I think some people are going to try to pick a low number hoping that others will have been avoiding it for the reason above. 4 seemed like a good compromise."
279,4,I've won this game in the past with 4
280,4,Data scientist
281,4,"Many people will try to submit relatively high numbers. Some people will realize this and submit numbers closer to 1 as a result, trying to win. I guess that most people will not think to submit 4 and will rather go for the low-hanging fruit of 1, 2, or 3."
282,4,"I am guessing that folks will avoid picking a very low number, so I am trying to exploit that by picking a low number. Except that at least one person will try this same strategy for 1-3, so I am picking 4 (I don't expect it to work)."
283,4,"1 or 2 is too low. When picking a random number, I suspect most people lean towards odd numbers, so, 4 it is. Probably way too low; this one seems ripe for collusion and automated entries..."
284,4,4 is a good number.
285,4,"Some one will inevitably pick 1 or 2, but maybe skip the next few for higher ones"
286,4,"I suspect most people who think on this are going to try for prime numbers. One is altogether too cute and someone will try it. Four is the first non-one prime number.

Course, anything you can count on your fingers is a likely target, so but I can't think of a better criteria off hand."
287,4,It's one of the smallest positive integers.
288,4,Because it's gonna win!
289,4,"Last week there were 3 comments on the Riddler page. I assume more people participate than comment, but there can't be thousands of participants so why not try for a non-round, non-prime number near the bottom of the pile?"
290,4,I picked 4.
291,4,it's the lowest number that no one else will pick.
292,4,"I was taking too long trying to think about Nash equilibrium and estimating the number of people that will be playing this game, so I decided to ignore all of that and guess a small number that might be overlooked. Also I like the number 4."
293,4,"I'm betting most people will be assuming that the lowest numbers (1-10) are already taken and won't choose those.  Of course, there are others like me thinking the same thing and would then choose them, so while I'd *like* to choose ""1,"" I'm not, because I figure there's at least one other person out there who did so based on that same thought process.  So, I decided to stick with a low number, but choosing four, as I just feel like it's gonna be skipped over."
294,4,"I reviewed studies showing that, when selecting a number at random, people are more likely to pick odd numbers and prime numbers than computers are. So I picked the lowest even, non-prime integer that was available."
295,4,4 is an integer
296,4,"4 is a pretty unassuming number. I figure 1 to 3 will get a fair number of picks, and beyond that random selections of larger numbers."
297,4,People will overlook low numbers because they are too obvious. I think 4 as an even number might get jumped by many people.
298,4,Trusting my gut
299,4,The first three numbers have already been selected ;) and no one will think of submitting 4.
300,4,It's my favorite
301,4,"The lowest number is 1, but probably a few people picked that assuming that no one else would risk picking the lowest number.  A few people realizing that 1 is a bad number probably picked 2.  Some other people picked 3 because of the first two assumptions and because 3 is lucky for some people.  If you didn't pick 1, 2, or 3 then it's probably just up in the air and you pick a lucky or favorite number. I picked 4 because its low enough to have a good shot and because its a stupid enough number that maybe no one else picked it."
302,4,"I feel like there are 2 groups of people in this world: bold and timid. There will be some bold guesses of 1, 2, and 3, and some high number guesses. I'm hoping no one thinks about the number 4!"
303,4,aa
304,4,aa
305,4,aa
306,4,cause no one else would?
307,4,My girlfriend liked it
308,4,Hmmm - wild guess
309,4,"Chosen on the off chance that people avoid the single digits. 4 seems slightly more plausibly not chosen than 1, 2, or 3."
310,4,get em all
311,4,Just a random guess
312,4,Going for the gold.
313,4,I don't think anyone will pick 4.
314,4,"Didn't feel right, a little too low and a little too high"
315,4,Maybe people will skip it!
316,4,aa
317,4,It is an unlucky number in China.
318,4,"http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/02/05/is-17-the-most-random-number/ in between where other people highly likely put there money (1,2,3) and where more sophisticated estimations would land."
319,4,"This is the lowest number I could convince myself to try.  I figure quick responders that would answer 1 just for kicks may go through a logical iteration or two, but not three.  I expect to lose this game and am curious to see by how much."
320,4,"hope this number had been forgotten to try as a forgotten one as it is highly unattractive number. The One could be tanken by notunderstanding the question, Two for ""nobody would go so low reasonably, Three not for the reason as Two so next one is Four. Four is a little further from One and an unattractive number, makes it more likely to be forgotten in the game. Everything else comes to luck in gambling."
321,4,Guess
322,4,"The lowest integers will likely have multiple submissions, but who picks 4? Me."
323,4,A lot of people would choose the lowest positive integer i.e 1 without reading that you need a unique number. The next number is 2. The smarter ones will go for that.
324,4,I believe 4 will go unnoticed.
325,4,Seems solid to me.
326,4,"I'm hoping a large majority of people assume that they must pick a large number to have a chance, leaving a small number open. Though it seems unlikely, picking between 1 and 10 under the 10% likelihood that one of them is open leaves a much better chance than picking between 100 and 500 with a 75% likelihood one of them is open."
327,4,No reason.
328,4,Cause it's even
329,4,"I sacrificed a virgin to a volcano, and my god instructed me to submit the number 4. My magic 8-ball concurred."
330,4,"I didn't do much work. Not even sure how many people are likely to reply to this. But I am being a bit of a contraction in choosing this, thinking no one will choose such low a number for fear of a collision."
331,4,Some will choose very low numbers in the hopes that they were skipped by all others. I'm hoping four is the first one that is truly skipped by everybody!
332,4,Trying to get lucky
333,4,"Psychologically, people will tend to go for numbers that are odd and seem unique, such as primes. I also think many people will attempt to go for 1 and 2. So I went for the first compound number above 1."
334,4,"Honestly not really sure, figured that most people would go something higher as to be unique but first the numbers would still be taken."
335,4,Low :)
336,4,"Rule of three. I thought people would be more likely to pick 1, 2, or 3, but perhaps not 4."
337,4,4 is the magic number
338,4,everyone's gonna overthink it
339,5,oh come on
340,5,N/A
341,5,"Theoretically speaking, the likelihood of a lower number being chosen is very likely, therefore making it not unique and not a winner. People who know this will then think about choosing a higher number. It just comes down to luck of who will pick what number, depending on their rationale and why they pick a particular number. I am willing to bet that 1-4 will be taken, but someone will think it is ridiculous to still pick a single digit number since others will have the opportunity to do so. So I am choosing a single digit number that isn't small, isn't a lucky number ( 7 13 etc) and one that is still risky enough to be close. 
"
342,5,Most people choose 6 or 7 but nobody ever thinks of 5
343,5,You have to go for a low number and just hope no one else picks it.
344,5,No work.  Just  intuition.
345,5,My kids picked it.
346,5,Thinking nobody (else) in their right mind would pick such a low number.   Plus I like 5.
347,5,I used a random number generator
348,5,I'm greedy
349,5,um...it's my lucky number
350,5,.
351,5,get em all
352,5,Guess!
353,5,They'll never see it coming
354,5,aa
355,5,aa
356,5,"Hoping that the majority of people pick a high number, overlooking that people may leave some pretty low integers unpicked."
357,5,I went with the most bland and common number I could think of since everyone will be going for the most unique. People will think single digit integers are too small to pick and be unique.
358,5,No reason.
359,5,"People don't really like to choose multiples of 5 because they're too ""predictable"". 10 would have been my second choice but I wanted to go as low as possible in case people were guessing mostly in the teens or twenties."
360,5,Lowest possible number nobody will put here
361,5,It's a fairly common winner of the Nikoli Derby (http://www.nikoli.com/en/event/derby.html)
362,6,meh
363,6,"It is the only number (except 1) that the sum of all the primes up to 6 equal the sum of all the composite number up to 6, it is the smallest perfect number, it is the only perfect factorial, it is the largest integer to be both a factorial and a primorial, it is the only mean between a pair of twin primes which is triangular, and it is the only even evil perfect number."
364,6,We'll see!
365,6,lucky guess
366,6,Guessing that most people are picking 10+ thinking that someone already went for obvious.  Ignored 1-5 because the people who are thinking like me will go 1-5. plus 6 is a great a number.
367,6,"Most people will avoid low single digit numbers and try to probably guess some two or three digit numbers, which may actually make single digit numbers a good bet. Inevitably, other people will think of this, so the lowest single digit numbers are not a good option. I suspect the 1-5 will get multiple submissions, as will 7 (people seem to like the number 7), so I went with 6."
368,6,Hoping that other's overthink this and go too high
369,6,Someone has to ruin the low numbers for other people.
370,6,I hoped to get lucky
371,6,Who thinks of 6?
372,6,It's my favorite number
373,6,If figure people will avoid single-digit numbers on the assumption that they will all be taken.
374,6,"yeah, it's a guess"
375,6,"some people will go much higher thinking all the lower numbers are picked, its a gamble."
376,6,"It's low, but not too low, and people tend not to pick even numbers as much because they feel less random."
377,6,"1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 seem like obvious choices based on familiarity and common usage (1 is the lowest positive integer, a couple/duo/etc. for 2, lists of 3, table for 4, 5 fingers). After that, I would think most people would skip to the ""lucky"" number 7, leaving 6 as a, perhaps, lonely exclusion. Beyond that, I would think 8 or 9 might be reasonable choices, with response rates spiking again at 10 (our base numbering system), 13 (for being ""unlucky), and then slowly declining as one moves away from the lowest number with small spikes at ""round"" numbers (15, 20, 25, etc.)."
378,6,because somebody had to do it
379,6,lowballin
380,6,"Philosophy.  Humans are 5-fingered, and when given the option to pick a number without constraints, 1-5 are normally chosen.  6 is the lowest number not likely to be picked thus."
381,6,"A bunch of people will choose 1 because they don't understand the question. Some will choose 2 because they realize my first point. A few will choose 3 because they understand the first two points. So that leaves those who will select high enough to be unique among 1000-2000 guesses. I'm guessing the number will be even because odd and prime numbers ""feel"" more unique, therefore more people will choose them. My gut tells me 4 is just too low. I suspect that most people who understand the question will pick much too high, like 117 or 89. 6 seems high enough to be the number yet low enough to seem too low to pick."
382,6,"I think that people will pick more prime numbers because of the word ""unique"" in the question.  Six isn't one, and is also fairly low."
383,6,I thought all the other numbers were taken. I could be wrong.
384,6,Most boring number between 1-10.
385,6,"It sounded like the smallest ""uninteresting"" number. It's one less than lucky seven."
386,6,random guess
387,6,Why not?
388,6,"My guess is most responses will fall either in the two-digit range, or very low numbers like 1, 2, 3 (hey, someone’s gotta go for it). I figure there’s a slim chance I could slip in between those groups."
389,6,"Guessing most people guess odd numbers,  and choosing so low because hoping no one else will"
390,6,I think most of the numbers will be lowish 2-digits. I think everyone else will miss this one.
391,6,6 it is
392,6,I figure 7 is going to be popular - so guessed one below that.
393,6,High enough but not to high
394,6,get em all
395,6,"just a guess - relatively low given how many people will probably submit an answer, but high risk is required to win this game."
396,6,Figured I'd take a shot that most people would pick higher numbers assuming the low numbers wouldn't be unique. Chose 6 as it seemed the least interesting of the group between 3 and 12.
397,6,I think the numbers 1-5 might be obvious and other people would choose larger numbers and overlook something like 6
398,6,6
399,6,"Assuming (without much evidence) on the order of 1,000 submissions. Thinking that people will over think and avoid small numbers. 6 seems fairly unloved. And there you have it."
400,6,It seems low enough
401,6,Intuition
402,6,"My first several ideas were all primes, so I'm going for a low but not too-low non-prime."
403,6,Guess something low that other people would think is too low
404,6,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
405,6,aa
406,6,"6 is an unlucky, oft overlooked number."
407,6,"It’s low, but hopefully still a unique submission"
408,6,Dan Wilson... People like odd numbers. Figure many people will go higher.
409,6,2nd composite number
410,6,NO reason
411,6,It's my lucky number
412,6,I'm a genius
413,6,I assumed 1-5 would be covered
414,6,Counting on others to cover 1-5 multiple times.
415,6,"Assuming most people will be afraid to use small numbers, but others will try to outsmart the rest by using the lowest few."
416,6,I like 6
417,7,*shrugs*
418,7,George Costanza
419,7,"I think it might be a low number, but not too low to be unique"
420,7,I feel like everyone will go for 1-5 or higher random numbers.
421,7,Low enough to reasonably win; high enough to hopefully avoid spoilers
422,7,Just a fun number. What the hell.
423,7,seems lucky
424,7,"not to high, not too low, not too obvious"
425,7,I believe that all smaller numbers were chosen by at least one person by now.
426,7,get em all
427,7,My guess is most people will go much higher and a couple of people may try and poach the lower numbers. Hopefully only 1-6
428,7,Obviously 1-5 is gone. 6 is questionable but 7 is perfect.
429,7,"High enough to be unique, low enough to be low enough."
430,7,I am going for broke and guessing that few people will choose really low numbers & I like the number seven.
431,7,"It's so obvious, no one else will think of it"
432,7,Chose 7 because I think people will go very low hoping nobody else will go low.
433,7,aa
434,7,"Prime number that people will overlook because they think the picked number will be higher, but its not too gimmicky because some people will try to cheat the system and use even lower numbers."
435,7,Cause nobody will ever pick 7.
436,8,Just 'cause...
437,8,"Riddler responders are the kind of people who will pick a nice, round number, just because they think everybody else is going to be too scared to pick one. Maybe I can get lucky by picking close to one such number?"
438,8,Have you ever heard of Plato? Aristotle? Socrates? Morons!
439,8,"It's pretty low. I originally thought to do 133, but let's live a little, ya know."
440,8,"The low numbers will be taken, they just have to be.  7 will be taken, because it is a ""lucky"" number.   So I went with the next lowest number."
441,8,intuition?
442,8,"My original instinct was to put a - then hold down the '9' as long as I could, then copy and paste the numbers a few times. Then I saw that it was a positive integer. I then realized that integers include 0 and 1,2,3... etc . but was wondering if anyone would consider 0 to be positive. So then I decided to go for one, and talk about how it was the lowest positive integer. I then realized that it had to be unique! As in nobody else could pick your number! I then decided to go for my favorite number, 8, and hope for the best. I love the number 8 because I am a fan of Alexander Ovechkin, and am from the DMV area. I also thought that somebody is going to pick the so-called ""lucky"" number 7, and that the oft forgotten 8 would be the next lowest pick. *Dab*"
443,8,Gotta makes sure no one wins with a single digit number. But hey if I win I win.
444,8,...
445,8,Because it's luckier than 7.
446,8,Random
447,8,"My professor for game theory was Mark David Ward, who literally wrote the pa[er on inverse auction theory."
448,8,It's my favorite number
449,8,Because 8.
450,8,"1-5 will get selected and the likely hood of someone selecting 6,7,8 is probably close to the same"
451,8,"There are two large unknowns:
1) How many people are going to participate in this challenge.  Clearly the smaller the number of participants, the more likely a small number will win.
2) How other people will answer.

I'm going to assume that the distribution is bi-modal:
- Greedy participants that'll choose some distribution near 1
- Conservative participants that'll choose a number avoiding the greedy participants clustered at 1

With these assumptions I'm imagining the distribution exponentially falling, but with a very high tail (e.g. 50*exp(-0.5*x) + 2).  Given this I'm hoping that there will be a Poisson fluctuation down to zero in the 5-15 range.

We'll see how unique my thinking is.  (Can't wait to see the distribution peak between 5-15, lol)"
452,8,High single to low double digit may slip through.
453,8,It's less than 9.
454,8,Random!
455,8,Someone has to pick the low numbers :-)
456,8,it's gonna be low
457,8,Seems like a good spot
458,8,Seems pretty obvious that at least someone would pick 7.
459,8,"I almost submitted '1', on the theory that someone had to, but then thought that since that was my first inclination, someone else would.  I thought about '0', on the theory that the populace at large might not think it was 'positive', but that the judges at 538 might think it was.  I rejected that because 0 really isn't positive, and I didn't want to win with something I thought was wrong.  If 0 wins, I'd rather be righteously indignant ;-)  I ended up going with 8 because with all its factors, it seems like a very 'common' number, while other people might try to come up with a 'unique' number like 7 or 13.  We'll see!  Without knowing how many people will participate, it's hard to make a decision."
460,8,0 - 7 might be non-unique..
461,8,So I dont feel foolish if someone else wins with 8.
462,8,This number just doesn't seem like many people would pick it.
463,8,My wife says 8. Gotta pick your battles.  ;-)
464,8,get em all
465,8,Common number but not the most common.
466,8,why not?
467,8,Crazy Eights
468,8,Balance
469,8,"It's impossible to give a good defense of any given number if you don't know how many people are playing. Seven (along with three) is famously the numeral people are most likely to choose at random; eight is the next-lowest number. It's an unassuming number. If 8 isn't the lowest number, well, there must be *somebody* submitting these small numbers. Why not me? I dunno."
470,8,It felt right
471,8,"dunno, I like 8"
472,8,"I feel like no one will choose low numbers because it would be obvious.  I think majority of numbers chosen will be between 15-30, but no one will go for a low number like 8.  Taking a risk"
473,8,"idk man, 8's too predictable i guess"
474,8,"Low, even."
475,8,aa
476,8,It felt right
477,8,Favorite number
478,8,8
479,8,Snowman for good luck.
480,8,Eight is a popular satisfying number. I think people will tend to pick numbers that feel obscure and that tend to be too high.
481,8,i have no idea
482,8,It's the lowest unique number of all responses you'll receive.
483,8,"There is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies for this game, so lets pretend I computed a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, randomized appropriately and came up with a choice of 8. Or maybe I just like the number 8."
484,9,Hope no one else picks it
485,9,It came to me in a dream.
486,9,"There is no work. 9, because why the fuck not? Who would be stupid enough to answer 9 to this question?"
487,9,"A number comprised of a series of digits, subtracted from its reverse, always results in the same unique number for series of the same length.  All 3 digit series of numbers (e.g. 345 subtracted from its reverse 543) result in 198.  All 2 digit series of numbers (e.g. 12 or 23 or 34) when subtracted from their reverse, result in 9.  9 is the lowest possible unique number since two digits is the shortest possible series of positive integers."
488,9,I think everyone else will mindgame themself off of picking a 1-digit number
489,9,Birth Date. Usually this number chase me
490,9,"unclear how many people will participate, but I'm guessing it will be enough that at least two might choose each of the lower integers."
491,9,it's a good number
492,9,"You have to pick something.  I picked a very low number, but figured that other people would pick the few numbers below mine."
493,9,4+5=9
494,9,Because 7 8 9
495,9,"Pretty arbitrary, to be honest"
496,9,"A unique number is the difference, a constant, between consecutive digits in ascending order and descending order. The lowest unique number, also a positive integer, is 9. 21-12=9, 32-23=8, etc."
497,9,It all comes back to 9.
498,9,"I think nine might be lower than the actual answer, but maybe everyone else will think that too."
499,9,The optimal answer depends on the (unknown) number of participants and their (unknown) strategies.
500,9,Seemed like a good number.
501,9,intuition
502,9,"It's my favorite number, low, and I'm guessing that people will go mostly higher to try to be unique."
503,9,If you flip it upside down its a 6

513,9,"I do this game at the end of my middle school math classes, if we have a minute or two of free time at the end of the period.  All the kids write down a positive integer on their paper (without showing anyone else their number) and then I call out, ""who wrote 1?""  If one person (and only one!) raises their hand, they win.  If more than one, they're all out.  Then I ask, ""who wrote 2?""  etc.  Until we find the unique lowest number.  The kids get a kick out of it, and try to psychoanalyze each other to change their guess each round.  One class I had a kid who wrote ""1"" ALWAYS -- so if the class didn't want him to win, *someone* had to sacrifice themselves and write, ""1,"" too :)  The winner is pretty much always a number from 1 to 10.  But the class is only a class of 27 or so... so who knows if among your multitudes of participants, if the answer will be bigger...?"

516,9,"Numerous people will all pick 1, 2, or 3, so those numbers are foolish choices. A few sly people will shoot for 4, 5, or 6, as I was tempted to do. The numbers 7 and 8 are way too popular, so I, of course, must choose 9. ""Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!"""
517,9,Guess
518,9,N/A
519,9,People will overlook a random low figure attempting to accurately predict a higher figure; discounting the linear nature of the problem.
520,9,"It's a gamble that some people will try for lower single digit numbers and others will try for higher primes, missing out on a high single digit like 9."
521,9,"guessing that others will go much higher, expecting all lower numbers to be guessed"
522,10,I feel like most people will pick an odd or prime number thinking it will be unique. All single digit number will probably be submitted. 10 feels like a number that people will not choose because it is too commonly used.
523,10,"Most of the single digit numbers will be taken by people trying to go as low as possible or just prevent others from winning. You must go reasonably high to guarantee uniqueness, but that gives you almost no chance of winning. I saw 10 as a number that not many would choose because is has the perception of being a number everyone thinks of, thus causing no one to choose it. 10 is a very low number, but not low enough to get everyone thinking to pick it."
524,10,"Applying some reverse psychology. People will probably go for more ""unique"" numbers, so I'll pick a nice round number."
525,10,"It ""looks"" less random than odds, primes, etc. So perhaps nobody will choose it, because it seems less obvious."
526,10,"There's a small amount of empirical data showing 10 is statistically less popular than other small numbers in the decimal system. Assuming lots of people guess a single or small double-digit number ""just in case"", why not try a lower popularity small integer."
527,10,"I figured people may be trying to think of odd, prime, or ""more unique"" numbers than a nice easy round 10. 10 is probably too low to be unique, but worth a shot."
528,10,"Just a feeling it might be overlooked. This is so volatile I thought people might neglect picking a ""normal"" or ""base"" number"
529,10,Someone will forget about the lowest 2-digit number
530,10,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
531,10,"Hoping to get lucky and that others think it's too low and too ""round"" to be played. I'd expect the real answer to be at Number of Participants divided by 20ish though."
532,10,"I figure people will try the first few numbers.  After that, most people will pick a ""random"" low number.  When people try to pick a random number it often times follows a subconscious set of rules (not even, not numbers that are divisible, not numbers that mean something), and most people end up picking the same ""random"" number. 10 is probably too low, but it might just sneak in since it holds so much significance that no one else will pick it.  Therefore, I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you."
533,10,"Teachers have a knack in multiple choice A-D questions to hide their answers in the middle (B or C), and in a similar way, I think that people submitting this answer will feel safer with a number that appears hidden (I'm guessing that odd integers not divisible by 5 will be the most common answer in this riddle). While I think that there will be those trying to outsmart the game by choosing ""1"" or ""2,"" I think 10 as the base for our decimal numerical system is perceived as too common for being an answer, and something undesirable for entering into a situation that calls for the perception of being unique. Unfortunately, by submitting a form that requires people to ""show your work,"" it is likely encouraging everyone to overthink this problem, which will likely result in several others choosing 10 as an all too common number. If this were the case, I fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is Never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less well known is this: Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line."
534,10,Seems like a number many people would skip because it is too obvious.
535,10,"How many fingers do you have? Yeah, 10. That's what I thought."
536,10,"I suspect all one-digit numbers will be chosen. Prime and odd numbers seem more ""unique"" so I suspect they will go as well. 10 may or may not."
537,10,"well, I figured if 10 is the least commonly picked number between 1 and 10, then it has a better than average chance of not being picked.  see also https://web.archive.org/web/20150228025301/http://nfrom1to10.appspot.com/results/"
538,10,"Just instinct. The lowest few numbers actually seem promising, because everyone will be thinking ""no one would pick numbers THAT small, too obvious"". However, others will be thinking that too! So at least a few will choose very small numbers, thinking they are going against the grain. So I want to go a little higher; seems like 10 is somewhat ""obvious"" too, so I hope won't be chosen by anyone else."

546,10,Fav
547,10,"I'm going with 10 because I'm guessing all the single-digit numbers will be taken. 10 seems like a nice round number to guess, and I'm banking on everyone else thinking the same and opting for a less obvious number. :)"
548,10,aa
549,10,aa
550,10,"Without knowing the number of people who will submit numbers, I guess that the lower numbers will be duplicated but the higher numbers will be too high, plus people will choose non-obvious numbers, so 10 has a chance of bring the lowest unique number because of its obviousness."
551,10,I picked something that seemed like a popular nimbler hoping people would avoid it.
552,10,"Gotta go low.  My first thought was 17, but I recognized that I was choosing it because it's an ugly number and therefore seems unique... but other people likely had the same reflex.  10 is too obvious.  Maybe so obvious that it was overlooked?"
553,10,Meh
554,10,Everybody is going to think 10 will be taken!
555,10,Too round to be common
556,10,I expect others will overthink it. Or will cheat by making many many submissions
557,10,"Because it's a common, but not common, number."
558,10,"Figured enough people would answer, that it would likely not be a single digit. On the other hand, wanted to pick a number that wouldn't be considered 'unique' by other people trying to guess. This question is similar to lowest unique bid auctions."
559,10,"Relatively low if we imagine lots of responses. Also, it does not feel like a ""rare"" number that people may pick. But perhaps everyone does."
560,10,God
561,10,Guess
562,10,it seems low but too obvious for other people to choose.  Also I feel like this depends partially on how many responces you typically get.  I def wouldn't pick  7 tho--I bet theres a lot of 7s lol.
563,10,round numbers may be too obvious to select
564,10,The number is probably going to be a low number that people assumed others already chose. When selecting a number people are more likely to choose an odd number and prime numbers because they believe others will not think of it. I chose 10 because it is an obvious number that most people will probably forget about.
565,10,lowest positive integer is just any whole number and I suspect a lot of people will send in 1-5. The plan is then to pick a number that people would not regularly choose.
566,10,"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/most-popular-numbers-grapes-of-math/

On that list the lowest number after 1 is 10. I wanted to not count that because it's such a round number but then the next is 16 and there has to be nerds guessing all the powers of 2 and the next is 18 (chai) so I didn't want to guess that so 10 it is..."
567,10,"""ten is a stupid number to pick, pick a weird number that nobody else will"""
568,10,Seems like a number that is too common to be common
569,11,"The assumption is that most people will pick higher numbers in an effort to be unique. Some people will pick number one as a gamble against everyone outsmarting themselves.
People will continue to pick either low of high (3 digit) numbers leaving a gap of 2 digit numbers.
I'm estimating numbers 1-10 will be chosen more than once (just by counting fingers) so I'm trying eleven (Count Rugen may ruin this plan)"
570,11,Because
571,11,"Obviously most really low numbers (1-10) are going to be picked by a large number of people.  This might mean that they're actually a good choice, since most people will realize that and avoid them.  But I anticipate the Riddler audience will contain a decent number of 'one level up' readers, who will understand that.  This leads to the Sicilian Problem - I have to model what level my opponents are playing at.

Eventually, this path leads to madness and indecision.  I considered submitting my age, or a moderately-large prime number (or, better, one less than a moderately large prime) but I then decided '11 will do'.  I doubt this was unique, though.  Still, it should be more unique than most lower-level players will do, though anticipated by higher-level players than myself."
572,11,Seems like a nice enough number to choose
573,11,"Some people will choose 1. Realizing that, some people will choose 2. Realizing that, some people will choose 3, etc. etc. The trick is to go one step further than everyone else, but how? 
The previous popular submissions (Riddler Nation wars 1&2) had approximately 1,000 entries. Let's assume 1,000 will enter this one too, because it's a nice easy number. Assuming they're all logical player, let's say half (500 players) choose 1, half as many of that (250 players) choose 2, etc. This means by the time we get to 10, we're down to 0.977 players (let's round that to 1)."
574,11,"The battle for Riddler nation had 1382 submission. If half those people pick 1, and half of the remainder pick 2, and half of the remainder pick 3 and so on, the first number without a whole person left to pick it is 11. So basically this is a wild guess."
575,11,The density will decrease rapidly as the integers get larger; I think there is a psychological anchor at double digits
576,11,"I think everyone will try a single digit number. I feel most people will be hesitant to use a double digit number, except those that are much higher."
577,11,Born on the 11th
578,11,It felt right.
579,11,Mine goes to 11
580,11,S.W.A.G.:  A scientific wild-ass guess.
581,11,No real reason
582,11,completely arbitrary
583,11,"Oh, it is mostly a guess. I figured the single digits were likely to be duplicated, but that there might be better odds with the low double digits."
584,11,"Trying to anticipate how quickly people will leave single digits is tricky. 11 is just beyond the double digit threshold. It's also prime, which I feel like may make it more forgettable. Finally, it was my number in baseball growing up."
585,11,There will be a big cluster close to one then a random dispersal trailing to a round 1-billion. 11 feels big so people will avoid it. God's speed!
586,11,Most people will choose a number 10 or lower or a common number. I chose the lowest prime above 10.
587,11,"It was difficult to gauge how many people submit to the Riddler Express, for that seems an important piece. But in the absence of said information, I went with 11, the first double digit prime. There is no dominant strategy, for if there was, someone else would pick it, and then we'd lose. We have to guess under the number of players N, as some number under that would be a winner. Otherwise, it might be best to avoid low numbers, as someone is bound to try going low, and avoiding commonly chosen numbers (7,10,12,etc.)."
588,11,"Restating the challenge, we are to pick a number that is sufficiently low, and sufficiently unpopular. 

The only rule that I used in determining popularity was to choose a prime number. I've observed a tendency when people are asked to name a number at random to pick a nonprime number. There is something innately attractive about numbers that can be divided evenly by other integers. While I haven't rigorously tested this, a quick perusal of numbers selected as favorites, such as sports uniform numbers or NASCAR vehicle numbers leads me to believe that prime numbers--especially two-digit prime numbers--appear less frequently than if numbers were assigned by mere chance. 

So then the question is what the lowest number that is unlikely to be selected by anyone else likely to be. I selected 11, because it is the first two-digit prime. For whatever reason, I think that single digit primes are exceptions to the rule that prime numbers tend to be less popular than nonprimes."
589,11,It is my favorite number
590,11,"A guess that more than 1 someones will go for the gusto of 1-9, so I expected a whole bunch of 10s. I was also born in November."
591,11,pretty much chosen at random
592,11,"I figure that all numbers up to 10 will be chosen a bunch. Pretty arbitrary, but there's really nothing else to be done here than guess."
593,11,It's kind of low?
594,11,Just going with my gut.
595,11,get em all
596,11,I have no idea how many people submit here...
597,11,Well...
598,11,11 is my favorite number!
599,11,"It's my second favourite number, I thought my favourite (6) was too low:)"
600,11,"It's my lucky number. It's low enough that I could see it actually winning, but since it's not single digit hopefully no one else guesses it."
601,11,There is no way that people all doubled up on any numbers higher than this (or at least the odds feel pretty slim) at the same time I feel like it fits the happy medium of non repeatable and still low enough
602,11,My reasons are my own.
603,11,It's a prime number and it's lowish. I think people don't often think about the number 11.
604,11,First Prime number above 10
605,11,aa

610,11,Picking a large # is a crapshoot. Hoping people overestimate the number of others picking low numbers and choose #'s which are too large. 11 is a prime so its hard to arrive at by chance.

620,12,"It's a good number, Brent."
621,12,Why not 12?
622,12,Lucky guess
623,12,"It's an even, easily divisible number so unlikely to be picked by people who are trying to find a random number that others won't choose, but very low also, so if I am in fact the only person to choose this number it is likely I will win."
624,12,"It's my favorite number, and it's small enough to win but large enough that people won't get there by adding a few to 1."
625,12,Bots are going to make me wrong :(
626,12,Because 1 + 2 = 12
627,12,"I don't have real ""work."" And since I'm unsure how many submissions you receive, I can't do much in the way of estimation. My logic followed that all single digits would likely be chosen, therefore duplicated. I'd guess the first unique number would be between 11-30, roughly, so I went on the low end."
628,12,Random number generator
629,12,Gut.
630,12,It is high enough to be out of 1-10 and not too common of a number.
631,12,1-10 has a large probability of being chosen. 11 also has a high chance.
632,12,"It ""feels"" right"
633,12,Just guessing
634,12,i chose 12
635,12,12
636,12,Was chosen by a random number generator
637,12,why not?
638,12,Not so low that anyone will pick it
639,12,"I thought the single digits would all be taken, but once we're into double digits, I don't think there's anything special about 12. Also, each number higher you declare requires that every single number less has 0 or >1 guess, so I think the actual answer is likely to be below the average (and also the median) submission."
640,12,"I think picking a number between 1 - 10 is too risky given the number of people that read this website.  Also, I think it's likely multiple people will think they are clever in picking low, uncommon prime numbers.  People making their choices based on what they think other people did are more likely to avoid commonly used numbers.  Therefore, the greatest commonly used number greater than 10 is 12."
641,12,Lucky Guess
642,12,Classic gut instinct. Great problem.
643,12,Thinking
644,12,"Many people will choose small numbers. Many people will pick odd numbers like 3,5, 11,17 etc. So 12 seemed about right.

 The main issue is how many people are participating. The more participants the more crowded the smaller numbers get. I guessed it's hundreds and so thought 12 was about right."
645,12,Favorite number
646,12,Not a single digit + not 11?
647,12,get em all
648,12,Because
649,12,"Figured most people would avoid low double digits, but that a lot of gutsy players would aim for each of the single digits. I've got a feeling that there will be a gap of sorts between the slamming 9-1 get and the group of people who flock to the high 20s and 30s. Just a feeling."
650,12,because twelve is the twelviest
651,12,Someone will pick 1 through 10. So an unlikely number above 10 I guess 12
652,12,"I figure a lot of people are going to choose relatively high numbers, so I'm just trying to undercut them."
653,12,Assume all single digit numbers will be selected.
654,12,I hope that people are attracted to prime numbers. 12 is the opposite of that.
655,12,Relying on luck.
656,12,Birthday
657,12,Gut feeling
658,12,"I figure all the primes will attract people, as will 1-10, so I picked the next number that isn't a prime and is over 10."
659,12,aa
660,12,I assume others will overestimate the risk of choosing numbers with many dividers.
661,12,Pure guesswork :)
662,12,My birthday

664,12,Seems legit
665,12,Wild guess
666,12,12 is an ugly number.
667,12,"I think all numbers under 10 will be selected, as well as unique numbers like prime numbers. So, I picked 12 which is the lowest number over 10 and not prime."
668,12,"I think most people will anchor to odd numbers because your intuitive first thought upon seeing lowest positive integer is 1. Based on typical follower interaction, I anticipate maybe 150 responses, and I think all single digit responses will be used multiple times. Also wanted to avoid any ""round"" numbers such as 10 that easily come to mind."
669,12,So obvious it has to be it.
670,12,deep thoughts.
671,12,"12 is so ordinary i think it might be missed. When people think unique they tend to prime numbers, and 12 is pretty much the complete opposite of a prime number"

684,13,"Everyone will aim very high or very low, and no one seems to like the number 13"
685,13,"everyone will pick 1, 2, 3 etc. There's diminishing returns to picking a higher number at some point. I'm also at work and don't have the time to calculate what that sweet spot is, so 13 is a solid lick finger test the wind direction kinda thing. I also don't play golf, and I don't know if that metaphor even makes sense anymore, so there you go :)"

688,13,"It's pretty low, but the type of unlucky number I'm hopeful others will avoid."
689,13,Simple guess due to trolls and Nash equilibrium
690,13,"We played this game in my intro info theory class, I was one of the suckers who picked 1 thinking no on else would. Lots of people did. The distribution was approximately exponential, with 30 people and the winner picked six. I figure at this much higher scale, doubling feels right, and 13 is a cooler number than 12. Totally an eyeballing guess."
691,13,"Unlucky, maybe that will make people avoid it."
692,13,I've really got nothing to go on other than dumb luck.
693,13,Numbers below 10 are probably gonna be filled with trolls. The best option. Like the coffee pot problem is to take as low as a reasonable number as possible.

But then I realized that other people would do that as well and then I didn't want to mess with the chance that they wouldn't choose it because they knew other people knew that other other people wouldn't choose it because it's the lowest. Then I was like screw logic I'm picking 14. Also 110 isn't much loved so I was going to go with that, but then I thought someone in riddler nation might also have access to google so I was like screw it I'm going with 14."

The other number is almost chose is 32 because it is the first not birthday number in play. Not much math involved here...

Basically, every number from 1-10 is going to be wildly popular, since they are the most common, and they make up every other number. Submitting 1-10 would be highly risky. If it works, it would be because every other person was psyched out. After that, unique numbers like 11 and 12 (not called one-teen or tendy-two) will attract people to pick them, as will 13, a highly polarizing number). Therefore, I'm picking 14, in hopes that it will be ignored by everyone else.

801,15,"I was torn between choosing this, and choosing 4. I presume tons of people will trollishly choose 1 and 2, and probably a couple of people will choose 3-10. 15 seems both common enough (not prime, not as popular as similar numbers 13, 16, or 18) and boring enough to make it through."

This problem begs people to avoid choosing very small integers like 1, 2, and 3, for example. However, some people will likely call the bluff and choose these small integers anyway just in case. It is a matter of choosing a number which is small enough to win, but random enough that there is probable cause it could win.

Therefore, I picked the number 15 because it is my favorite number. There is really no logic to be had beyond taking a good guess and hoping nobody else chooses it."

808,15,"probably the majority of 538 readers, if i'm predicting right, will think ""well, i can't pick a single digit number, because everyone else will have picked it, so i have to do something like... 25, to avoid hitting anyone else's number.""

the people you're competing against are other readers of fivethirtyeight - it's reasonable to assume that these are people who are at least a standard deviation smarter than the average bear. then, you divide that group further given that they had to click ""Pick a number, any number"" and decide to submit one with a form like this that asks for just a touch of effort. what's that group like? it'll include casual and regular/committed readers, probably a handful of data professionals or at least people who work with analytics and data professionally, and some of them will have some pretty good reasoning about the numbers they choose too. while a good deal of the rest of them are more like me - just sort of spectators who read a lot and aren't that dumb. a good deal of them are just here for the sports and politics and predictions, and decided to take a casual puzzle on because it sounded at least mildly interesting. some are just here to see if trump's approval rating has gone down meaningfully or some other politics related thing - there's a very small set, in other words, of people who came specifically for the riddler. and there's also probably a set of people who are relentlessly competitive, which is where i fit in.

what kind of numbers do they all choose? the more casual readers, particularly the ones just here for glancing at the sports and politics, probably pick something in the 10s or 20s. it'll be the people feeling particullarly risky and brave or aware of their own biases who'll pick something the single digits. zero will be picked by a bunch of people who are slightly having a laugh, so that's out. a lot of people will submit ""one"" just for the sake of it"", so that's out. at least a couple of clever buggers will do 2, 3, etc... except this kind of runs into a more important question. you can identify these sub groups all you want, but how many people in total are actually applying? i just mentally think ""500"" maybe, but now, at this point, i really have no frame of reference. i can reason ""this is a smaller subset of general 538 readers and people who clicked that headline"", but i have no idea how many people that is in the first place. how many people see the 538 homepage every day? dunno. how many people out of that group click into the riddler? dunno. and without knowing that it's... harder to guess whether numbers like ""4,6,8"" etc are taken - you kind of just assume they are out of caution.

so... with that direction a bit trickier to figure out, maybe, i think, it's better to think about what kind of numbers people will pick casually first, and then eliminate those - and i think what people will pick casually first, is their favourite numbers (which means, 7 is out). so i just google what people pick. what are the most common favourite numbers? at least that way i can get some more numbers definitely excluded. so i went to here https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/most-popular-numbers-grapes-of-math/

and i didn't see 15 on this list. it feels risky, because it's a multiple of 5 and of 3 too, it feels like it'd stick out in people's minds. at the same time... some part of me thinks ""just go for it roxy"", so i did.

828,16,"I would be presumptuous, indeed, to present myself against the distinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened if this were but a measuring of ability; but this is not a contest among persons. The humblest citizen in all the land when clad in the armor of a righteous cause is stronger than all the whole hosts of error that they can bring. I come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty—the cause of humanity. When this debate is concluded, a motion will be made to lay upon the table the resolution offered in commendation of the administration and also the resolution in condemnation of the administration. I shall object to bringing this question down to a level of persons. The individual is but an atom; he is born, he acts, he dies; but principles are eternal; and this has been a contest of principle.

Never before in the history of this country has there been witnessed such a contest as that through which we have passed. Never before in the history of American politics has a great issue been fought out as this issue has been by the voters themselves.

On the 4th of March, 1895, a few Democrats, most of them members of Congress, issued an address to the Democrats of the nation asserting that the money question was the paramount issue of the hour; asserting also the right of a majority of the Democratic Party to control the position of the party on this paramount issue; concluding with the request that all believers in free coinage of silver in the Democratic Party should organize and take charge of and control the policy of the Democratic Party. Three months later, at Memphis, an organization was perfected, and the silver Democrats went forth openly and boldly and courageously proclaiming their belief and declaring that if successful they would crystallize in a platform the declaration which they had made; and then began the conflict with a zeal approaching the zeal which inspired the crusaders who followed Peter the Hermit. Our silver Democrats went forth from victory unto victory, until they are assembled now, not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment rendered by the plain people of this country.

But in this contest, brother has been arrayed against brother, and father against son. The warmest ties of love and acquaintance and association have been disregarded. Old leaders have been cast aside when they refused to give expression to the sentiments of those whom they would lead, and new leaders have sprung up to give direction to this cause of freedom. Thus has the contest been waged, and we have assembled here under as binding and solemn instructions as were ever fastened upon the representatives of a people.

We do not come as individuals. Why, as individuals we might have been glad to compliment the gentleman from New York [Senator Hill], but we knew that the people for whom we speak would never be willing to put him in a position where he could thwart the will of the Democratic Party. I say it was not a question of persons; it was a question of principle; and it is not with gladness, my friends, that we find ourselves brought into conflict with those who are now arrayed on the other side. The gentleman who just preceded me [Governor Russell] spoke of the old state of Massachusetts. Let me assure him that not one person in all this convention entertains the least hostility to the people of the state of Massachusetts.

But we stand here representing people who are the equals before the law of the largest cities in the state of Massachusetts. When you come before us and tell us that we shall disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your action. We say to you that you have made too limited in its application the definition of a businessman. The man who is employed for wages is as much a businessman as his employer. The attorney in a country town is as much a businessman as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis. The merchant at the crossroads store is as much a businessman as the merchant of New York. The farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day, begins in the spring and toils all summer, and by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of this country creates wealth, is as much a businessman as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain. The miners who go 1,000 feet into the earth or climb 2,000 feet upon the cliffs and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured in the channels of trade are as much businessmen as the few financial magnates who in a backroom corner the money of the world.

We come to speak for this broader class of businessmen. Ah. my friends, we say not one word against those who live upon the Atlantic Coast; but those hardy pioneers who braved all the dangers of the wilderness, who have made the desert to blossom as the rose—those pioneers away out there, rearing their children near to nature’s heart, where they can mingle their voices with the voices of the birds—out there where they have erected schoolhouses for the education of their children and churches where they praise their Creator, and the cemeteries where sleep the ashes of their dead—are as deserving of the consideration of this party as any people in this country.

It is for these that we speak. We do not come as aggressors. Our war is not a war of conquest. We are fighting in the defense of our homes, our families, and posterity. We have petitioned, and our petitions have been scorned. We have entreated, and our entreaties have been disregarded. We have begged, and they have mocked when our calamity came.

We beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy them!

The gentleman from Wisconsin has said he fears a Robespierre. My friend, in this land of the free you need fear no tyrant who will spring up from among the people. What we need is an Andrew Jackson to stand as Jackson stood, against the encroachments of aggregated wealth.

They tell us that this platform was made to catch votes. We reply to them that changing conditions make new issues; that the principles upon which rest Democracy are as everlasting as the hills; but that they must be applied to new conditions as they arise. Conditions have arisen and we are attempting to meet those conditions. They tell us that the income tax ought not to be brought in here; that is not a new idea. They criticize us for our criticism of the Supreme Court of the United States. My friends, we have made no criticism. We have simply called attention to what you know. If you want criticisms, read the dissenting opinions of the Court. That will give you criticisms.

They say we passed an unconstitutional law. I deny it. The income tax was not unconstitutional when it was passed. It was not unconstitutional when it went before the Supreme Court for the first time. It did not become unconstitutional until one judge changed his mind; and we cannot be expected to know when a judge will change his mind.

The income tax is a just law. It simply intends to put the burdens of government justly upon the backs of the people. I am in favor of an income tax. When I find a man who is not willing to pay his share of the burden of the government which protects him, I find a man who is unworthy to enjoy the blessings of a government like ours.

He says that we are opposing the national bank currency. It is true. If you will read what Thomas Benton said, you will find that he said that in searching history he could find but one parallel to Andrew Jackson. That was Cicero, who destroyed the conspiracies of Cataline and saved Rome. He did for Rome what Jackson did when he destroyed the bank conspiracy and saved America.

We say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of government. We believe it. We believe it is a part of sovereignty and can no more with safety be delegated to private individuals than can the power to make penal statutes or levy laws for taxation.

Mr. Jefferson, who was once regarded as good Democratic authority, seems to have a different opinion from the gentleman who has addressed us on the part of the minority. Those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business. I stand with Jefferson rather than with them, and tell them, as he did, that the issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out of the governing business.

They complain about the plank which declares against the life tenure in office. They have tried to strain it to mean that which it does not mean. What we oppose in that plank is the life tenure that is being built up in Washington which establishes an office-holding class and excludes from participation in the benefits the humbler members of our society. . . .

Let me call attention to two or three great things. The gentleman from New York says that he will propose an amendment providing that this change in our law shall not affect contracts which, according to the present laws, are made payable in gold. But if he means to say that we cannot change our monetary system without protecting those who have loaned money before the change was made, I want to ask him where, in law or in morals, he can find authority for not protecting the debtors when the act of 1873 was passed when he now insists that we must protect the creditor. He says he also wants to amend this platform so as to provide that if we fail to maintain the parity within a year that we will then suspend the coinage of silver. We reply that when we advocate a thing which we believe will be successful we are not compelled to raise a doubt as to our own sincerity by trying to show what we will do if we are wrong.

I ask him, if he will apply his logic to us, why he does not apply it to himself. He says that he wants this country to try to secure an international agreement. Why doesn’t he tell us what he is going to do if they fail to secure an international agreement. There is more reason for him to do that than for us to expect to fail to maintain the parity. They have tried for thirty years—thirty years—to secure an international agreement, and those are waiting for it most patiently who don’t want it at all.

Now, my friends, let me come to the great paramount issue. If they ask us here why it is we say more on the money question than we say upon the tariff question, I reply that if protection has slain its thousands the gold standard has slain its tens of thousands. If they ask us why we did not embody all these things in our platform which we believe, we reply to them that when we have restored the money of the Constitution, all other necessary reforms will be possible, and that until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished.

Why is it that within three months such a change has come over the sentiments of the country? Three months ago, when it was confidently asserted that those who believed in the gold standard would frame our platforms and nominate our candidates, even the advocates of the gold standard did not think that we could elect a President; but they had good reasons for the suspicion, because there is scarcely a state here today asking for the gold standard that is not within the absolute control of the Republican Party.

But note the change. Mr. McKinley was nominated at St. Louis upon a platform that declared for the maintenance of the gold standard until it should be changed into bimetallism by an international agreement. Mr. McKinley was the most popular man among the Republicans ; and everybody three months ago in the Republican Party prophesied his election. How is it today? Why, that man who used to boast that he looked like Napoleon, that man shudders today when he thinks that he was nominated on the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. Not only that, but as he listens he can hear with ever increasing distinctness the sound of the waves as they beat upon the lonely shores of St. Helena.

Why this change? Ah, my friends. is not the change evident to anyone who will look at the matter? It is because no private character, however pure, no personal popularity, however great, can protect from the avenging wrath of an indignant people the man who will either declare that he is in favor of fastening the gold standard upon this people, or who is willing to surrender the right of self-government and place legislative control in the hands of foreign potentates and powers. . . .

We go forth confident that we shall win. Why? Because upon the paramount issue in this campaign there is not a spot of ground upon which the enemy will dare to challenge battle. Why, if they tell us that the gold standard is a good thing, we point to their platform and tell them that their platform pledges the party to get rid of a gold standard and substitute bimetallism. If the gold standard is a good thing, why try to get rid of it? If the gold standard, and I might call your attention to the fact that some of the very people who are in this convention today and who tell you that we ought to declare in favor of international bimetallism and thereby declare that the gold standard is wrong and that the principles of bimetallism are better—these very people four months ago were open and avowed advocates of the gold standard and telling us that we could not legislate two metals together even with all the world.

I want to suggest this truth, that if the gold standard is a good thing we ought to declare in favor of its retention and not in favor of abandoning it; and if the gold standard is a bad thing, why should we wait until some other nations are willing to help us to let it go?

Here is the line of battle. We care not upon which issue they force the fight. We are prepared to meet them on either issue or on both. If they tell us that the gold standard is the standard of civilization, we reply to them that this, the most enlightened of all nations of the earth, has never declared for a gold standard, and both the parties this year are declaring against it. If the gold standard is the standard of civilization, why, my friends, should we not have it? So if they come to meet us on that, we can present the history of our nation. More than that, we can tell them this, that they will search the pages of history in vain to find a single instance in which the common people of any land ever declared themselves in favor of a gold standard. They can find where the holders of fixed investments have.

Mr. Carlisle said in 1878 that this was a struggle between the idle holders of idle capital and the struggling masses who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country; and my friends, it is simply a question that we shall decide upon which side shall the Democratic Party fight. Upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital, or upon the side of the struggling masses? That is the question that the party must answer first; and then it must be answered by each individual hereafter. The sympathies of the Democratic Party, as described by the platform, are on the side of the struggling masses, who have ever been the foundation of the Democratic Party.

There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it.

You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard. I tell you that the great cities rest upon these broad and fertile prairies. Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.

My friends, we shall declare that this nation is able to legislate for its own people on every question without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation on earth, and upon that issue we expect to carry every single state in the Union.

I shall not slander the fair state of Massachusetts nor the state of New York by saying that when citizens are confronted with the proposition, “Is this nation able to attend to its own business?”—I will not slander either one by saying that the people of those states will declare our helpless impotency as a nation to attend to our own business. It is the issue of 1776 over again. Our ancestors, when but 3 million, had the courage to declare their political independence of every other nation upon earth. Shall we, their descendants, when we have grown to 70 million, declare that we are less independent than our forefathers? No, my friends, it will never be the judgment of this people. Therefore, we care not upon what lines the battle is fought. If they say bimetallism is good but we cannot have it till some nation helps us, we reply that, instead of having a gold standard because England has, we shall restore bimetallism, and then let England have bimetallism because the United States have.

If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we shall fight them to the uttermost, having behind us the producing masses of the nation and the world. Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."

938,18,"With no knowledge of what everyone else will submit I assume the distribution will have a low population in the single digits and teens, then rising up across the rest of the double digits, and dropping down again for the triples.

Basically the gambit is that some people will guess the single digits trying to sneak in hoping no one else chooses them since they're obvious. My hope is that enough will pick them that they'll get doubled up, but that not enough will do that in the teens, and I'll sneak through."
939,18,Who the heck is going to say 18
940,18,There is no point choosing a single digit number. But there will be people who either don't know this or they think everybody would know this and use it as winning strategy. What you want is a number that is low enough to have a chance to be unique but heigh enough that nobody else uses it. 18 might be that number.

And then my last submission would be n+1 and hopefully n+1 wins. I lose if some guy's robot got further along than me."
976,19,It's my favorite number and it's semi unusual for people to pick
977,19,"Assuming a high number of responses, then there should be enough variation in people's logic to cover the single digits. Then it's a matter of choosing a low number that didn't occur to anyone else. 19 seems likely to be ignored as being the highest in the teens."

991,19,"I guessed that all single digit integers will already be chosen, and 19 feels obscure enough out of the 10-20 range that it might get passed over."
992,19,"My intuition suggests that a gamma distribution is a  good match for the distribution of guesses. I will assume that on average at least one person other than me will choose x=1. So I will take a distribution with scale parameter 1 (for simplicity) and shape parameter chosen so the Prob(x<=1.5) ~1/1000, where 1000 is my rough estimate for number of other people playing. This shape value is roughly 6.95. I want to choose the first x* such that Prob(x<= x*) ~1/2000, so there is a large probability I will be the only person to take it. This corresponds to x*=19."

994,19,"Lots of people don't seem to pick primes when picking ""random"" numbers.  However, with as many people as read this blog, people are bound to pick the first several lowest spots.  I was debating between 17, 19, and 37, so I went with the middle one"

1001,19,Sounded Nice
1002,19,"Just a guess...I know people generally avoid guessing numbers with ""1"" in them (ex: the frequency of the number 1 in forged documents is lower than it is in legitimate documents). I wanted to choose a single digit number but I am sure many other brave souls already have. Also, I love 538 but I don't think thousands of people pay attention to the riddle page, so I am sure that the lowest unique integer is not only going to be below 100 but it will also be a neglected number on the lower end. Hence, 19."
1003,19,It seems like a number people will forget about choosing.
1004,19,"I have scientific basis but I feel like the respondents will form into two camps: those who don't worry about duplicating and submit a very low number (<10) because they think everyone else will fall into the second camp - those too worried about duplicating so they choose a rather high number (>50). 19 is a prime number on the low end of the 10-50 range. People don't like prime numbers, right? I was going to choose 17 but I feel like that number is on people's mind more than usual because it's shorthand for the current year."
1005,19,"18 seemed to low, 20 seemed to high..."
1006,19,Did not want one too low as more people would take it try to find one maybe no one else would take.

1010,19,Dumb Luck
1011,19,"Because no one ever chooses 19. Except me, this one time."
1012,19,"Everyone will submit 1 or 2 or 3.  Some people will go higher, but pick favorite numbers (7, 10, 12, 15, 17).  It's just luck, but I think 19 might be unique."
1013,19,Nobody thinks of nineteen
1014,19,I like primes.
1015,19,"Just low enough that it could win, just high enough that nobody is going to pick it."
1016,19,I guessed!
1017,20,"I think most people's strategy will be ""pick a random number that's pretty low"". To be unique you have to avoid numbers selected by that strategy. I know that human beings tend to pick random numbers poorly: avoiding even numbers and multiples of 5 since they seem less random. I want a low number that's the opposite of that."
1018,20,To win.
1019,20,"Obviously can't go too low. Lots of people will pick primes and other odds as they ""feel"" less obvious. Hopefully people will think that 20 is too obvious."
1020,20,No real reason.  Maybe people don't like numbers divisible by 10 because they're too obvious.
1021,20,I thought people will be likely to pick single digits and avoid round numbers because of the natural tendency to want to pick round numbers.
1022,20,It's a guess. Might be a better estimate if I knew how many people were participating.
1023,20,Why not?

1028,20,Gut feeling! :)
1029,20,"I have to figure a lot of readers of this column are going to game theory their way to the really low numbers, so I want to stay low while avoiding that scrum."
1030,20,"I figure people will try to be unique by choosing unusual numbers, so I'm picking a normal one. 10 seems probably too low. Not sure how may people will submit to this."
1031,20,Feeling that people will stay away from 'round' numbers in favor of 'unique' numbers (like primes).
1032,20,"It is a round number, not too low, which perhaps people will steer away from in favor of a seemingly more uncommon number."
1033,20,"When asked to pick random numbers, people shy away from the big 0-ending numbers, so I think all the multiples of 10 are less likely to be picked. My guess it that someone at least will try 10 and all other numbers under 20, but I think there's an outside shot 20 will get dodged because it's not ""random"" enough. We'll see!"
1034,20,"I'm guessing that most people will assume that too small a number will be picked by other people, and that other people will second-guess that decision and pick the smallest numbers under the assumption that no one else would try that. A ""weird"" number like 23 will probably be picked by those who are trying to be unique, so I'll pick a nice round number that everyone else (hopefully) will assume other people would have already picked. 

I wouldn't be terribly surprised if a really small number wins, like 4."

1039,20,"All the single-digit numbers should be thoroughly covered up.  The winner's going to have to get a little lucky.  I expect there will be several hundred submissions overall.  I'm banking on people taking uncommon numbers rather than nice, round ones."
1040,20,"20 is typically the least chosen number if a group of humans is asked to pick a random integer between 1 and 20, which seems like a somewhat related problem."
1041,20,20 is a very unassuming number. Low enough to win and enough factors to not be chosen.
1042,20,"The solution (if there is any) must be strongly dependent on the number of submitters which is unknown to me. So I think this is a very luck dependent strategy, going too low won't win (well, except everyone else thinks so too), going too high won't win either obviously. So I tried to go for a middle ground."
1043,20,Lol
1044,20,Who would pick 20?
1045,20,"I selected a number that is higher than the simple one-digit range because many people will likely select those.  I selected 20 because I decided that most people who thought up to this level would pick a number that seemed ""random"" and would pick an odd or a prime or something, so I picked 20 as it is a very boring number.  I doubt this wins."
1046,20,"guessing that lots of people will pick a low number hoping no one else does, so picking one slightly higher to avoid the crush.  34 is a pretty boring number so maybe doesn't get picked (not prime, not a significant age, not a birthday, not a square, etc.)"
1047,20,"When you don't know how many participants there will be, it is difficult! I think enough people will say really low numbers. I think a lot will try higher numbers. I am trying something low but not too low."

1052,20,"Think people will submit 1-10. People trying hard to figure low, ""unique""-looking numbers will go 11-19, 21-29. Think round number is less likely to be picked."

At the same time some people have modified their strategy to account for that by choosing lower numbers that the previous category think will all be taken. My strategy is to place myself in the lower end of the middle of these two groups, but where that middle is I can only guess."
1064,21,"I assume that single digit numbers, numbers in the teens, and round numbers (10, 20, 30, etc) will be fairly common, and this is the first number that isn't any of these."

1104,22,"Few others would choose such a non-random looking number, surely?"
1105,22,"But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of FiveThirtyEight readers: are they the sort of people who would select low numbers, with the hope that no other has selected the same integer? Now, a clever man would select a number greater than 50, because he would know that only a great fool would assume the lower numbers would be left untouched. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose a number less than 50. But, you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose a number greater than 50. 

Am I finished? Not remotely. Because Mr. Krishnan could have recently visited Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me to resist choosing a low number, so I can clearly not choose a number greater than 50.

But you must have suspected I would have guessed the submission's origin, so I can clearly not choose a number less than 50. 

Therefore, I choooooose....58. 

What's that you say?  I'm wrong? You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched numbers when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is ""never get involved in a land war in Asia"" - but only slightly less well-known is this: ""Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line""! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...

1106,22,I'm guessing most people will choose primes. I have to assume all the numbers 1-5 will be taken (by people messing with the system if nothing else) and someone will take 6-20. So 22 is the first acceptable number after that.
1107,22,No
1108,22,lol
1109,22,Why not?
1110,22,No real logic here. I wanted to go high enough to be unique while trying to stay pretty low.
1111,22,"I'm unsure of the number of people who submit answers to the Riddler, but it's likely to be in the thousands. Most people will assume they'll need to enter a number between, let's say 70 and 200, so I'm pretty sure one of those smaller numbers will slip through the cracks.

From another perspective, people will instinctively try to pick odd and prime numbers to try and ""stand out"", but that biases against even numbers and multiples of 5. So here we go!"
1112,22,"I needed a number that was low enough to beat out my opponents, but also one that everyone overlooked. I figure 1-20 will go pretty quickly, but as soon as the numbers got into the twenties it all comes down to picking a number that other people wouldn't. 22 is just ""popular"" enough that people will be scared from picking it, but just low enough that it gets the job done."
1113,22,"Most people when asked for a number will not choose one with repeating digits. Of course, everyone is trying for the lowest number that no-one else has picked. Save for 11, the lowest number with two digits the same is 22, and people trat the numbers through the teens differently - as if they were individual, not place notation."
1114,22,"My wife, who hates math, told me it was the first number that popped into her head after I explained why 1 was probably not the best answer."
1115,22,"When asked to choose a random number, most people choose prime numbers or numbers that have individual digits far removed from each other. 22 has a repeat and seems like a boring normal number, while being high enough to dodge what I'm sure is a cluster in the single digits and teens. It seems like thinking too hard about this almost makes one more likely to lose."
1116,22,"It's not a very special number, and it's low enough to win but not low enough to be submitted by other entrants!"
1117,22,get em all
1118,22,Neither to high to not be lowest or to low to not be unique and not a number I expect most people to pick. A complete guess
1119,22,"I figured that people would gravitate towards low numbers and prime numbers. And a few hundred (or maybe a couple thousand) people would participate. So I tried to think of a nondescript, non-prime number low enough where I had a chance of winning, but not so low that someone else with a similar thought process would also grab it."
1120,22,Figures bunch of people will say other stuff below this
1121,22,Seems about right.
1122,22,"Based on the poll here: http://web.mit.edu/thinkBIG/challenge/popular.htm
This is the first number to not show up on the left. I hope no one else thought to do this."
1123,22,This will be some kind of Pareto distribution. I wanted to be just outside my guess for the median guess but low enough to still win. I figure people will avoid numbers with obvious patterns.
1124,22,It's just a guess
1125,22,1-20 Are too common. 23 is prime and likely to be chosen. 21 is blackjack.
1126,22,I felt people would look too far out and miss an early number like this.

Hopefully no-one remembers Michael Jordan. ;)"
1171,23,"From past 'social experiment' type Riddlers I know that >1000 people answer these. 23, a little-loved prime, seems high enough that I have a chance at being unique while still being low enough that it'll undercut some other attempts."

1223,25,"I decided 1-10 are off limits, over 50 is unlikely to be good enough with only 1000 responses, assuming this draws similar interest to other puzzles.  I couldn't.  I am hoping people will steer clear of round numbers, so I'll try 25."
1224,25,"It is so dumb that no one would choose it.  Trolls will choose all of the single digit numbers.  Numbers that think they are fancy, like 17, will be chosen by prime number snobs.  The primes are terrible.  I estimate the number of participants in this competition at 1200.  I have sent prayers to all of the major gods requesting that I win this so that I am entitled to the substantial cash prize that comes with it."

1270,26,"Logic leads toward a conclusion that a pool of choices will concentrate toward lower digits, thereby leaving 1 as both the lowest possible number and the most likely chosen one. The obviousness of this conclusion, however, suggests that this simplest of answers, 1, will go chosen far less by those with any intellectual savvy about them. That this, too, is overtly apparent, will likely draw multiple contrarians along with the village idiot or two to selecting this answer, 1. This leaves 2 as the second greatest and second worst answer, for the same reasons, and 3 as the third, etc. ""I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you, ...and can clearly not choose the wine in front of me."" The correct answer will have two digits, be greater than 20, will not be a prime number, as those are, by nature, perceived to be unique,  and will not be particularly associated with victory (23, 42) or puerile humor. The second lowest (to be safe) number remaining after all eliminations is 26."

1276,26,"Can't be too small, can't be too big. Something like 1000 people seem to respond to the crowd-sourced riddlers, and this one is so easy I imagine responses will be at least that high... and this feels like it might be big enough to be unique. Also it isn't a number like a prime or like 42 (see my email address) that has nerd-favorable qualities that attract extra attention."

Multiples of 5 or multiples of a dozen seem too common. There are 8 oz. in a common drinking glass, 16 oz. in a pint, and 32 oz. in a quart; so they seem like overused numbers (along with their multiples, such as 4, 12, 20, etc.).

1350,29,It's a good number
1351,29,thought I'd just pick a low ish prime number
1352,29,Random Guess
1353,29,Hopefully big enough to not have duplicates and small enough that no smaller number is unique.
1354,29,2. 9.
1355,29,Feeling. Wanted an odd and prime number. Guessing single digit and teens would likely be covered. And felt reasonable that about 30 would be covered (I have no idea how many answer this so hard to make a rational choice I think)
1356,29,Maybe it is weird and common enough to get overlooked...maybe
1357,29,?
1358,29,it is prime
1359,29,"High risk, high reward. 29 is a very low number, but if it works, it works!"
1360,29,Just thought about it in my head.
1361,29,Seems potentially high enough
1362,29,The perfect crib hand
1363,29,My birthday
1364,29,i expect most really low numbers (e.g 1-10 and probably most of the teens will be taken) and i think numbers with a lower second digit are more likely to be taken than higher. i'm not sure i could offer an entirely coherent justification for that instinct.
1365,29,29
1366,29,get em all
1367,29,Seems legit.
1368,29,Lucky number
1369,29,"A fair amount of people will try the double bluff - you want a low number, but loads of people will try a low number, but maybe because they know that, actually they won't go for a low number so I will. So I think single digit numbers will be really highly subscribed. The volume of people will drop for 10-25 but there will still be a decent chunk of people going for those numbers. My guess is that the lowest unique number will come somewhere in the next tier, say 26-40ish? My initial thought had been that it would be much higher than that - I should go for a number in the 70s for example - but on reflection I thought there would be some obscure number in a lower band that would make it through. I picked 29 specifically just because I had to pick a number and that seemed as good as any in the band I was looking at."
1370,29,"I've run this experiment with 10 people before many times. I know that there is no chance this many people will leave any of the bottom dozen alone, and from there I chose a relatively low prime (so, uncommonly used) number to rest my hat on."
1371,29,"In the words of common core responders 'I came up with it in my head'...but really, I thought a 'higher' number and one that was not a multiple of 2, 3, 4, or 5 was needed"
1372,29,Just a guess but thought a prime number might be less likely to be chosen by others.
1373,29,AA
1374,29,A prime. All sub-20 will be taken...
1375,29,"Every four years, there is one day with this number (February 29th).  The next year with this date will be 2020.  It is also a prime number that is not often mentioned in our society."
1376,29,It's a nice number.
1377,29,I figure 1-19 are too low; 2 and 9 are far enough away on the keyboard that I'm playing into the difficulty of typing.
1378,29,got married on the 29th
1379,30,It's the best
1380,30,No method to my madness
1381,30,It's pretty low.
1382,30,"I suspect that most answerers will avoid numbers perceived as being too ""obvious"" (i.e. perceived as common or special) since it's highly likely that someone else will pick that number. However, other answerers will realize this and try to get lucky by picking an ""obvious"" number that everyone else will avoid. I expect that the winning number will therefore be an ""obvious"" one that's just high enough to potentially avoid duplicate ""obvious"" guesses (for instance, *someone* will surely submit 1) but low enough to beat all the other submissions with the same strategy. I don't know how many people will submit answers, so at a wild guess I'll say that no one else will pick 30 and that this number is sufficiently low to win. (I suspect my odds of victory are not much better than straight chance, though.)"
1383,30,"Gut that people wouldn't choose such a low, round number"
1384,30,It's a nice number.
1385,30,Not too low not too high.
1386,30,"I think people will stay away from round numbers, but I could also imagine a bunch of people getting together to submit the first 20 numbers or so."
1387,30,Cuz Ima boss
1388,30,It seemed right
1389,30,get em all
1390,30,Just a guess
1391,30,It's round
1392,30,"I'd imagine prime numbers to be more popular, so I picked a highly composite one instead. Greater than 31 because there is a population that picks birthdays. Small enough that there wouldn't be (a lot of) gaps (I hope)."
1393,30,"538 readers are sophisticated, but maybe not *that* sophisticated. I choose a number that's rounded, because it seems so obvious of a choice that people might avoid it, and not too small, because the size of 538's reader base nullifies any kind of *read* that one might have, so that the first dozens or so integers will probably be filled."
1394,30,"print(random.randint(1,100))"
1395,30,aa
1396,30,"Multiples of 10 hopefully seem somehow 'less unique', so hopefully people won't choose them as often (?)"
1397,30,"Seems like a good compromise, and also my current age. Didn't choose a prime since people might have a tendency to go for them when picking random numbers."
1398,30,"I figure that many people are going to shy away from choosing 'obvious numbers' meaning number divisible by a lot of stuff and will lean towards primes and other numbers that's seem less common. However there will be many greedy people that will choose low numbers in the hopes that nobody else also chose them. I'm hoping that 30 is obvious enough that it will he over looked by others as too obvious, but folks picking obvious numbers (and hoping for the best) will choose smaller numbers like 10 and 20."
1399,30,My favorite number
1400,30,"It seemed high enough that other people might not choose it, while simultaneously low"
1401,30,Why not?
1402,30,"The smallest options are obviously out, and I'm guessing most riddlers will pick  a non-round number (and probably lots of primes picked, too) because they feel more unique, if that makes sense. I chose a not-too-small, nice, round number."
1403,30,Intuition
1404,31,I was going to choose 17 but that might be too random.
1405,31,"Guessing that people will choose lower, knocking each other out."
1406,31,Random shot in the dark
1407,31,Why the hell not!
1408,31,"not too big, not too small"
1409,31,Small but not too small
1410,31,no particular reason
1411,31,"Supposed reasoning:  Because a few thousand people will submit numbers, one would think that all the integers below 100 will be taken. Knowing that will cause people to overcompensate and select numbers well above 100. Knowing that some people will then over-overcompensate and select numbers less than 10. 31 is somewhere in between those groups, low enough to have  a chance but not so low as to be widely chosen.

Actual reason: 31 was my football jersey number in high school."
1412,31,Seems like a good number
1413,31,No Reason
1414,31,No work that just seems like a safe bet
1415,31,Blind Faith
1416,31,I picked a number. Any number.
1417,31,idk maybe no one will pick this one
1418,31,"There are a lot of people likely to respond, likely filling up any very low integers. The 30s seem like they might be open, and within them I hope the lower ones place to be open as well."
1419,31,Because people might forget about 31.
1420,31,I just knew
1421,31,"First thing that popped into my head when you said ""pick a number"" without even reading the victory conditions. But it seems reasonable. Low enough to maybe win, high enough that maybe others didn't pick it."
1422,31,it's prime
1423,31,Shrug
1424,31,"This follows the principals of a Unique Bid Auction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_bid_auction), where there's no real optimal strategy except to pick a number that most people won't. I'm essentially trying to guess what other people would have picked, and trying to not pick that."
1425,31,"Adonal Foyle's number, duh!"
1426,31,People forget about the 30s and Prime numbers. At least I hope they do.
1427,31,"Just a number I lik, I guess. Prime numbers are probably less popular."

1449,31,"It got Mike Piazza to the Hall of Fame. Plus, it is relatively low... I figure a bunch of people will choose single digit integers."
1450,31,"A couple thousand people often participate in these, so there will be sufficiently many who risk picking a tiny number. I picked a number that was admittedly risky given how tiny, and I also picked a prime number cuz nobody likes those."
1451,31,It was a guess
1452,32,Nobody can have this as the day of the month of their birthday.
1453,32,"You had 1538 submissions for the coffee riddle.  
I assume all the lower numbers that correspond with birth dates will be picked but that most participants will guess a higher number, assuming all the low numbers will already be picked.  
I also think many will pick prime numbers thinking those are less likely to be picked.


"
1454,32,Today is my 32nd birthday.
1455,32,Felt right
1456,32,Just felt right.
1457,32,"Was thinking, I didn't want to go too low, as picking one or two seems irrational.  Then, a number over 100 seems a little risky.  And since many will resort to their birthday or birth year, I picked the first non birthday number (and I'm assuming it wouldn't be a birth year for many readers)."
1458,32,Nobody picks 32 as a lucky number.
1459,32,I figured people would gravitate to prime numbers or perhaps their birth date so I picked the first number that avoided these traps.
1460,32,"because you probably won't accept ""bleven"" (see ""Nineteen Fifty-Bleven"" in ""Hollywood Said No!"" by Bob Odenkirk & David Cross)"
1461,32,seems like a good number
1462,32,"I figured numbers divisible by 5, or that were prime would be popular choices. Furthermore, based on the size of Riddler Nation, numbers under 30 would all be taken. This is the smallest number that meets these requirements."
1463,32,"Just a guess, went with a even number as I feel people in general will pick more odd numbers"
1464,32,Not a birth date
1465,32,Number of my favorite baseball player growing up
1466,32,"No way of knowing how many people will participate. I imagine it thins out enough by the thirties, but no way of knowing what the lowest untaken number would actually be, of course. Just kind of hope to get lucky."
1467,32,Because there aren't any birthdays on the 32nd.
1468,32,"I think people will try to choose ""random"" numbers--numbers they don't think anyone else will guess.  When trying to come up with random numbers, people tend to concentrate on 3s, 7s, and 8s (I think I've read that in a study somewhere).  I also think people will tend to guess lower numbers and that you'll get more submissions than average because this is an easy problem to guess at."
1469,32,Guess
1470,32,"Even, greater than 20"
1471,32,all
1472,32,It's underappreciated.
1473,32,"Well, my first thought was to pick an odd number, because, you know, odd numbers are kind of cool.  But then I figured everyone else would be picking an odd number also, so I thought to go with an even number.  Was thinking of an unusual even number (meaning of course one with only a few factors), but then I figured everyone else would be picking unusual even numbers, so I went with a very common even number with lots of factors, that hopefully no one else picks!  ;-))"
1474,32,"People tend to think that odd numbers are more ""random"", so when asked to arbitrarily pick a number people tend to pick odd numbers way more frequently. 32 is a guess that most people will be picking numbers from 1-30, and that most people are going to avoid 32 for it's property of being 2^8."
1475,32,AA
1476,32,It's an educated guess based on my estimate of participants
1477,32,.
1478,32,Feeling really lucky
1479,32,I smashed the numbers on my keyboard
1480,32,Seemed like a low # that might go overlooked. Also my daddy's baseball #.
1481,33,"I figured people would avoid numbers with factors, so might resist the draw to 2^n.  But in an attempt to resist numbers with factors some would be tempted to try (2^n) -1 as these are famously used in the search for primes, so I decided to go for (2^n) + 1.

That just leaves the value of n to choose.  Assuming P people submit, I'd guess they'll pretty much cover everything up to sqrt(P), so my choice became 33 or 65 depending on how many submissions you get.  I'm gambling on around 1000 entries and all the above guesswork voodoo being correct :-)
"
1482,33,"It's my favorite number, so why not"
1483,33,Larry Bird
1484,33,Yup.
1485,33,This number is easily overlooked. I had to think for a long time and I still almost didn't think of it. Are there numbers that are more easily overlooked? Definitely. Smaller than 33? None that come to mind...
1486,33,Aeluromancy
1487,33,"Frankly, it was mostly random, but I did put some amount of thought into it. I didn't want to go too low, so I decided to skip the single-digits, teens, and twenties. I chose 33 because I figured some people trying to choose a random number would be instinctually averse to repeated digits."

Odd numbers: out, people tend to pick those.  22: double digits.  24 has a lot of factors.  26 is the number of letters.  28 has a lot of factors.  30 ends in a zero.  32 has a lot of factors.  So 34 it is."
1508,34,It's just an uninteresting number.
1509,34,Its a lowish number
1510,34,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1511,34,I assume that people may want to pick uneven numbers. I also think the winning number will be lower than might be expected on first thought.
1512,34,"Anything below 20 I expect will be picked. 20 is my favorite number by quite round. 21-25 are too interesting to math nerds with common multipliers and a prime in there. 26 is intriguing, but it will thus be so for others. 29 the same. 31 is close, but 34 feels right as I think more people may go odd."
1513,34,"Above 31 since people may pick days of birth, and a couple higher than that since people may pick 32 by the same logic, and 33 is a nice number that may get picked.  Plus, Nolan Ryan."
1514,34,"It's not a date in the month, and 32, the next lowest number, is a power of 2. So 33 makes sense. But because 33 makes sense, I'm doing 34 as someone could think of what I thought."
1515,34,"With the castles problem, btwn 1000 and 2000 people participated.  Gut feeling with that large of a group is that the answer lies somewhere between 20 and 70.  (~10% chance of each number <100 being chosen...).  Some people might gravitate toward birthdates, so I want to be higher than 31.  I think you'll get more odd numbers in the response, so I went even."
1516,34,Just trying to get lucky! ;)
1517,34,I looked at the Wikipedia page for the Unique Bid Auction. I checked the mathematical analysis and realized I didn't have time to go through them. This is a random number between 30 and 40 calculated via random.org.
1518,34,"I feel like the point is to pick a number that's low (lower than you'd think) but not so low that other people choose it. The 30-50 range felt about right given what I think the distribution might look like, probably wrongly. Within that, I wanted a composite number because I think people think primes are unusual numbers and are more likely to pick those. And I wanted a number with few factors as well, because numbers with lots of factors are too common. 34 felt like it could blend in."
1519,34,"Half numerology, half inspired by the gamma distribution"
1520,34,"Seems low enough to have a shot, but not so low as to definitely collide.  The bottom 20 numbers seem really unlikely to work.  Others may think the same and go for the 20s.  The thirties seem like the first area where someone might get lucky.  I'm not sure how many submissions we'll see, but I'm expecting a winner in the 40s or 50s, but psychologically I'd rather fail boldly than lose timidly.  This number feels like it strikes that balance."
1521,34,It's my lucky number.
1522,34,It is a good number.
1523,34,Because
1524,34,Took a random guess in the late 20s early 30s
1525,34,It's my favorite
1526,34,My age and pure guesswork...
1527,34,"I am predicting a bimodal distribution: a narrow low-value mode corresponding to people who play to undercut, and a broader high-value mode corresponding to people who play to hit gaps in the right-hand tail of the distribution. The best number will sit in a valley of thin counts between those two modes. It is hard to guess where that will be! The recent coffee challenge had about 1500 entrants, so my intuition combined with some MATLAB simulations tells me that the valley of thin counts will be in the range of 25-40. What number to choose in that range? It should meet the dual constraints of not being a ""nice round number"" (like 30 or 40), but also not being a number overly loved by the types of math geeks who will probably play this silly game (primes, etc.). 34 just might do the trick, but it's a crap shoot no matter how you look at it."
1528,34,"Not too low, but hopefully unique enough to be low enough."
1529,34,It just feels right
1530,34,???
1531,34,Can't be a date of a month. Can't be one more so 32 is out. Then 33 is also out because two digits are the same. So 34
1532,34,Because why not?
1533,34,all
1534,34,"It is a relatively low, yet hardly thought of number. Most people would choose a more common number (35, 36), or very obscure integer (37), than this boring, average number."

1536,34,aa
1537,34,Hoping for the best!
1538,34,A random low-ish number that isn't a multiple of anything useful
1539,34,I'm guessing there will be a lot of people who play relatively low numbers (1-10) who think that others will not. Then a decent proportion of guesses between 10 and 50. I'm hoping to get lucky and that others in this range happen to not pick mine. Avoiding multiples of 5 and primes (since for some reason I think people are more likely to pick those values).
1540,34,hopefully greedy but not enough to be detrimental.
1541,34,An unremarkable number which hopefully no one else will pick. I expect 1-30 to be highly populated.
1542,34,I expect no one will even bother with the first 30 or so
1543,34,"Kirby Puckett, duh"
1544,34,"Just hoping. Seems like a fairly boring, fairly low number."
1545,34,"I figure a lot of people will try for low-ish numbers by assuming others are going to go high.  I relied on research into which lottery numbers people play the most often in an effort to avoid common lucky numbers.  Numbers over 31 are less common because people often use their birth date as a lucky number.  32 is a factor of 2, so I think some people like it for that reason.   Essentially, 34 is the lowest number over 31 that isn't interesting in any readily discernible way.  A paper based on the UK lottery confirms that it is among the 5 or so least commonly picked lottery ball numbers."
1546,34,"Let 'w' be the winning number. 
- 'w' better not be an exciting number so primes, squares, cubes are out. Even the *rather* composite-y kinds like 12 are out. 
- Ah, how about trying my date of birth... that would be sooo lucky!? So w>31. 
- Hmm.... 32 is a wild one (highly composite, 2^5, 32 Fahrenheit = 0 deg Celsius etc. etc.)
- 33 is cool, very cool. It is actually also rather sexy. 

So, the smallest number which also happens to be a listless and boring one in my viewpoint is 34."
1547,35,"It is a low number, but not an obviously low number. Also, it was Frank Thomas's jersey number and has always been my favorite number."
1548,35,"Low, but not too low, non-descript (no repeats, no pattern)"
1549,35,"There are several numbers visible on the page that might influence an attempt by some readers to submit a random number, these numbers should not be picked because they are like to be picked by someone else.  Additionally people tend to pick numbers associated with birthdays so anything under 31 and especially under 12 is risky.  Attempting to go low low but not under that threshold."
1550,35,guess; looks common so less likely to be chosen
1551,35,"I figure most people will pick 1, 2 etc so 35 it is"
1552,35,"I'm guessing there will be at least one gap in 10-100. 35 is a low, round number and may be forgotten."
1553,35,Cause all I do is win win win no matter what
1554,35,I'm not sure how many submissions you get per challenge. I guess there will be more with this one because it is so accessible. I'm just banking on everyone else doubling up on smaller numbers than this!
1555,35,cuz
1556,35,all
1557,35,aa
1558,35,"Hmmm. Figure that -someone- will take each of roughly 1-20, with a high cluster of guesses in the middle of that range. I think their will be a gradual drop-off in frequency from there, moving higher. Really didn't think about it any harder than that. Since I have no idea how many people typically enter these contests, it's more or less a shot in the dark."
1559,35,yolo
1560,36,Pick a random low number hoping no one else does.
1561,36,"random(20,50) and pray"
1562,36,"I didn't want to pick anything too low, since a lot of people will pick things like 1 'just in case'.  I also didn't want to pick anything too common, since the number has to be unique, so I avoided even numbers and primes, immediately obvious famous jersey numbers, etc.  I generated 36."
1563,36,Just a guess I hope for the best!
1564,36,"I figured most relatively low numbers would be quickly submitted. More importantly, I know there's a lot of evidence people think odd numbers are more ""random"" and prime numbers even more so. So I picked a square with lots of factors."
1565,36,"People tend to think of odd numbers as unique or ""special."" I tried to pick an unremarkable number with lots of factors that wasn't too large."
1566,36,"I think the number is going to be quite a bit lower than most realize. I'm estimating about 1500 submissions. Half of which will be 100 or more. That means that about 750 or so people will choose a non-random number of 100 or lower. I have to confess to not doing the math, but I suspect that sampling with replacement will show quite a few numbers less than 100 being 'unselected'. So, I originally choose 38 - a riff on the website name. But that's a dumb move, so I went with 2 less than that."
1567,36,good luck
1568,36,Why not?
1569,36,Because it's one less than 37
1570,36,"Tried to balance picking a small number with picking a large enough number that it is unique. Could pick something like 1638 and that would most likely be unique, but certainly not the lowest. On the other hand, picking a number like 10 only takes 1 other person picking it to disqualify you. This would become a little easier if the number of participants was known."
1571,36,"36 is my lucky number. Also, based on the assumption that 1500 people will answer (like the coffee problem), and assuming a Poisson distribution with a lambda of 20 (I think most people will guess around 20), it's at around 36 where there is likely to be be few enough guesses that I might get lucky."
1572,36,36 is seems high enough.  IDK

1591,37,It's a number I like that isn't too high or too common.
1592,37,"I expect there to be around a couple thousand entries, so I expect the lowest unique to be probably below 100. I wish I had a bit more of a mathematical explanation."

1601,37,Lucky number
1602,37,Seemed like the most random number at the time
1603,37,First number that popped into my head
1604,37,"The population of 538 readers that participate in these games is large enough that I expect all the single digit and low double digit numbers will be selected.  I have arbitrarily determined that it starts to thin out in the 30s, and that people are probably less likely (as a group) to pick prime numbers, so....here we are."
1605,37,Guess
1606,37,FTW!
1607,37,"my assumption is the winner will be 2 digits. many readers will pick their birth year, so anything 50-99 seems risky. round numbers (multiples of 5 specifically) will also be picked multiple times. numbers of famous athletes (ie 34, 42) seem risky as well. best to pick a number in the 20-49 range fitting those criteria."
1608,37,I chose 37 as the first prime number above the birthday numbers. Felt pretty good.
1609,37,it feels right!
1610,37,Very random guess that no one will pick 37
1611,37,random guess.
1612,37,guessed
1613,37,"No reason, just felt like it."
1614,37,I figured I should choose a relatively low number that's also obscure so I chose 37. A prime number that no one really thinks about very often.

1619,37,Lucky number.
1620,37,It's my favorite number (love those primes)
1621,37,Random enough someone else might not choose it
1622,37,"Ruling out 1-20. I have no idea how many people submit answers, but it can't be THAT many right? Prime numbers seem more unique.

That said, maybe based on this smart audience outsmarting itself, it will be something like 2."
1623,37,It's ugly.
1624,37,Prime number
1625,37,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1626,37,I guessed my favorite prime number
1627,37,"Hope it is low enough and unlikely enough to be the winner. Feel like I would just be matching numbers lower than this, but have no idea how many people will enter."
1628,37,"Guessing there will be enough people to rule out single digits and the teens, I like prime numbers so what the heck: 37"

1633,37,"It just feels right (plus, it's prime, and I❤️primes)"
1634,37,"I expect many folks to pick a ""higher"" number (but perhaps not triple digits). Similarly, I expect at least some readers to ""outsmart"" everyone and just pick the single digits and teens in the hope that no one considers that option. This feels like a happy medium."
1635,37,"Feel it's not too low or high, not a birthday or a date and as a prime number is easily forgotten as it's not in any factor tables. Who knows ..."
1636,37,Lucky guess
1637,37,Expecting most people to pick much higher.
1638,37,"I assume all numbers less than 31 will be chosen because of birthdays. Prime numbers are the best, so I chose the next smallest prime number."
1639,37,"A lot of people will pick their birth date, so I eliminated 1-31. 32-36 seem like common, popular numbers. So my answer is 37."
1640,37,"I chose a relatively low prime number, because I don't think that prime numbers are as popular."
1641,37,Why would anyone pick 37
1642,37,"It is the smallest irregular prime number, a category I've spent a lot of time thinking about.  It also seems about right, large enough to have a shot at being unique, but small enough to be small."
1643,37,37
1644,37,Because it's my favorite number.
1645,37,I guessed?
1646,37,Thousands may play but I'm hoping I'm one step ahead of them
1647,37,Whimsy
1648,37,Because it's not a number people will think of easily.

1668,37,I don't know.
1669,37,"You asked for a lowest unique positive integer. This means you can be the only one to submit the number. 1 is the lowest possible solution but the chances of someone else also submitting this is extremely high. The high you go, the less likely you are to overlap with some else. I have no math behind my answer, it is just a guess based on how I would expect others to behave."
1670,37,Low enough to be in the running. High enough to avoid the people who answer $1 on The Price is Right. 37 because it's everywhere.
1671,37,I just guessed
1672,37,Feels right

1675,37,It's the lowest prime number that doesn't fall on a day of the month (birthdays and such)
1676,37,"Smallest prime number above the most days in any month (31). My logic, beside the total luck in this game, is most people have a lucky number or a birthdate that they may pick.  37 is not only not common, yet also is impossible for anyone to be born on October 37th, etc. I'd assume this puzzle is completely random and depends on the number of people who guess and the typical number people guess the least often."
1677,37,Lowest prime greater than 31
1678,37,"Just took a guess - needs to be higher than a single digit number, but anything over 50 is probably too high to win. Wanted something spread apart on the keyboard to capitalize on lazy typing. It's prime, which might be good or bad."

On the other hand, people are trying to submit unique numbers so they will be more likely to submit non-round numbers. But everyone knows this so whole numbers might again become more popular. So I submitted a non-round number."
1686,38,.
1687,38,It just feels right
1688,38,"I used random.org to choose a random number between 0 and 100, then threw out what I didn't like until I got this."
1689,38,Just a low number that isn't necessarily common.
1690,38,Assuming 1000 submissions I tried to find a low number that isn't prime or otherwise notable. I assumed the first 10-20 would be guaranteed to be filled but after that the range of answers would expand.
1691,38,One more than 37 (the most random number between 1 and 100 ... :-)
1692,38,It's not that interesting
1693,38,just picked one.
1694,38,I picked a random number from 1 to 40 (expect it to be relatively low).
1695,38,no particular reason
1696,38,"Hard to guess without knowing the response population. I'd reckon the numbers 0-20 will definitely be chosen by people, while for 100(and all numbers below it) to be chosen youd need i think at least a few thousand responses(going for a sort of normal distribution with its peak around 25?). 38 seems like a nice incospicous number. Not too high for when im overestimating the response size, but not too low that its definitely going to be picked."
1697,38,No reason
1698,38,shrug
1699,38,My goal was to pick a randomly low number that was also high enough that someone probably wouldn't guess it.
1700,38,"Not too small (under 20 seems like it will be common), but not too large, and not a round or significant number that others might focus on."

1704,38,"avoiding the super low numbers and estimating like 1500 people will fill this out to get the area where i think it will be. avoiding primes because people love those, numbers that can be birthdays, and super even numbers like multiples of 5 or 10, oh and other special numbers like perfect ones even tho i love perfect ones."
1705,38,"37 is a commonly selected seemingly random number, reducing the odds of a 38"
1706,38,Guesstimate of other answers and how many replies you get
1707,38,I figured that the lowest number would probably be less than 50 so to eliminate bias I did a random number generator between 1 and 50 and got 38
1708,38,It's a reasonable small number that isn't particularly notable
1709,38,"When asked to pick a unique number, people often come up with a ""strange"" number - something prime or odd. 38 is a nice even number that could be overlooked. I didn't pick a number too low since more than likely readers will try their luck with the first few integers."

1711,38,all
1712,38,"A lot of people are likely to chose their birthday's day of month so 1-31 are out. 32 is mathematically interesting especially in this kind of group. 33 has nice symmetry. There is absolutely nothing special about 34, but since it the first such number people are likely to pick, some will pick 35 as a result of same thinking. 37 is first prime after all these numbers, so I'll go for 38"

1718,38,No clue how many entries you get for something like this. Just a guess.
1719,38,"I feel like everyone is going to try to find the ""most random"" number. According to some study I vaguely remember from Princeton or Harvard or something, most people consider odd numbers to be ""more random"" than even numbers, and prime numbers especially. Then there will inevitably be someone that submits different numbers repeatedly, probably starting with the number 1, then going up. There will also be plenty of people who just pick their favorite number, and according to another study I think I saw once, people's favorite numbers tend to be between 1 and 20, or squares of numbers.  I believe 38 is sufficiently far from submission-troll-territory, sufficiently ""unrandom"", and sufficiently disliked. Fingers crossed it works out!"

I can't assume the Nash Equilibrium is in place, so there is more likely more than one person that picked 1 out of sheer lack of understanding of game theory (of which I am not an expert in myself). Narrowed to an odd number because odds are less ""aesthetically"" pleasing. Save for integers ending in 7 because people have a tendency to think 7 is random, and 5 because our minds tend to work easier in sets of 5. So i decided it had to be an integer ending in 1, 3, or 9. I wanted to eliminate primes because I think smarter math folks will try to focus on primes. Then it's just trying figure out how high can I go. So I settled on 39. Thinking people would probably exhaust most options below that, while also trying to figure out exactly how many people would try, and within that how many a-holes just want to watch the world burn and submitted multiple bids to drive the number up.

Then, I imagine that many of my fellow Douglas Adams readers will be naturally distracted by 42. Avoiding this number 'once' suggests that 41 would be a reasonably-unlikely choice, and applying the logic a second time (murmuring something about Nash equilibria), gets us to 40, which I also enjoy as an obvious-enough-it-might-not-get-picked option.

With that in mind, I'm not picking based on an elaborate Nash equilibrium or principle. People won't pick round numbers at the rate they pick ""unique"" ones--primes, their favorite number, etc. I'm guessing that 40 is high enough that no one will guess it, but it's still surrounded by numbers people want to pick--like 37, which is prime, or 42, a common favorite number."

* I believe the winning submission will be somewhere in the 40's or 50's.

1896,44,It was the second-hand on my watch when I looked
1897,44,It's low but not too low. It repeats; perhaps people will avoid it.
1898,44,"Assuming there are approximately 1,000 participants, I am guessing that enough people will pick the very low numbers (1-10), hoping no one else picks them, that they do not win. I expect the peak in the distribution to be in the 20-30 range, and for it to drop after that, with single digit number of picks for numbers in the 40s. There will definitely be higher picks, but the competition is to pick the lowest number that no one else picks.

1917,46,"We know from Riddler Nation that around 1200 people will contribute. That's a useful stat - with 10,000 contributors, I'd need to be looking at a higher number. So what number? Not too low, obviously. Lots of people will think, ""Well, no-one's going to be stupid enough to go for 1, so if do, I might win!"" Then, mathematically inclined people may go for mathematically important numbers such as primes. Best to avoid those. And other people trying to avoid primes might go too far in the other direction, so that rules out anything like multiples of five or ten. I think 46 hits the sweet spot - not too low that lots of people will try it, not too obscure but just obscure enough."
1918,46,"47 is the most frequently occurring number in the universe, thus, people are unlikely to choice a number close to it."

But everyone else will probably have that idea too, so I decided to go with a number in the 40's."
1924,46,"Feeling it out, I feel like numbers in the 40's might be where an opening could first appear.  In that range, I'm feeling 46 is an unremarkable number, but not remarkably unremarkable, that it could be in the Goldilocks zone of remarkability.

Below 20 doesn't sound like a good idea. More than one person is bound to pick 1 or 2 as a longshot. Good old rock, nothing beats it.

I also expect some numbers to be over-represented for cultural reasons - everyone loves primes, right? So, I picked 48 because it's boring and composite highly composite."
1983,49,"So there are 90 unique positive two-digit integers. I'm guessing the number of people who go guess a two-digit integer will be low enough that there will be a significant probability that some two-digit number, if guessed, would win.

2082,54,"Suppose 2000 other people submit numbers.  The probability that 1 is a winning play is the probability that nobody else submits 1.  If everyone picks randomly with a distribution that selects 1 with that very probability, it is a solution to (1-p)^2000 = p, which, numerically, is about 1/343.

I couldn't think of an effective way to extrapolate this strategy to larger numbers, so I rolled a virtual 343-sided die."
2083,54,"Judging by previous participatory Riddlers, there should be about 1500 entries (probably a bit more than the others, since this one is more straightforward). I chose 54 based off the fact that the 54th triangle number is the first triangle number greater than 1500. Fairly arbitrary selection, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. At the very least, it doesn't seem like it would be a popular number (like 42 and 69).

Pretty please post all of the numbers less than the winner which had only two selectors. I am super curious about ""near misses"" and people who had their picks spoiled by just one person. Also, all the numbers greater than the winner with only one selector and those less than the winner with no selectors will be interesting. Or you know... drop that .csv on the hub of gits."

2095,55,For the number of entrants n>=3 the equilibrium is mixed. We don't know what n is - however for previously submitted games is it in the low 1000s. All strategies over n/2 + 1 are strictly dominated.  Consider x as a choice strategy. In equilibrium no choice gives a higher probability of winning than another. But If you increase x it requires more non-unique entries. Hence the probability assigned to x (denoted p(x) ) is monotonically decreasing. Although mathematically cumbersome it appears for small n that p(x) is approximately 2(n-x) x<=n/2 and 0 otherwise. The median winning entry is n/6. I decided to randomize with the caveat to avoid numbers that might be over selected.
2096,56,"It's unremarkable in most ways (not prime, not a key part of any major sequences), and is hopefully large enough to not get otherwise picked."
2097,56,"A number in the tens might just be low enough to be unique. 56 is a multiple of several numbers, and it is even. Even numbers seem less likely to be chosen. A number in the fifties is hopefully high enough to avoid being chosen twice or more."
2098,56,"Take a well known, small prime number[1] and subtract 1.

2099,56,"First let's see what game theory says we should do.
Assume N>>1 players.  Optimal play is to choose each possible number n with probability p(n) such that you can't do any better by another probability distribution.  Therefore p(n) is a distribution such that the winning chance is 1/N for each n-choice.
What is p(1)? On average N p(1) people choose 1; the chance that no-one else does is approximately e^(-N p(1)); if I choose 1, my chance of winning is therefore e^(-N p(1))  which should equal 1/N, so
p(1) = ln(N)/N
The total chance that someone wins with this strategy is
(number who try it)*(chance to win) = N p(1) * (1/N) = p(1)
and the chance that no-one wins with this strategy is therefore (1-p(1)).

Similarly the chance that picking 2 will win is Exp[-N p(2)] (1-p(1)) which should also equal 1/N, so p(2) = p(1)-p(1)/N.  And
Exp[-N p(m)](1-p(1)-...-p(m)) = 1/N or
dp/dm e^(Np(m)) = -p(m)
I don't quite see how to solve this but it's clear that the typical m-value is of order N/ln(N)
If I assume 1000 players then the typical number to pick is in the 150 range.

But people are bad at picking random numbers, they like either very round numbers or primes, so I should pick something smaller which is neither very round nor prime.
So I tried 56.  We'll see how it goes.
"
2100,56,Took the first number that came to my head and subtracted one because if 57 came to mind immediately that might happen to someone else.
2101,56,5*6 = 30
2102,56,"It's yet another Nash Equilibrium problem. Probably most people will understand it as such, so I feel like it's at least possible we get complete saturation here, but I'm somewhat arbitrarily choosing a number much high than I think the equilibrium would work out to."
2103,56,Not too high
2104,56,The other riddler nation games seem to have 20 percent people playing a spoiler/ cheese attack (something like picking 1-20 is my estimate) and then a large part playing a 3rd order defense and playing to conservative. this is my attempt to split the difference while also picking a bland number (no primes no squares)
2105,56,Pure guesswork

2107,56,There can't be *that* many nerds playing this game.

2109,56,"I want to avoid the first 40 numbers because they are likely so low in the order that at least someone will pick it. I want to avoid anything 90+ under the asumption that at least 1 number below will not be taken, as well as the fact that the 90-110 numbers are likely to be popular due to close prosimity to 100 (Y'know, base 10 centrism). Under the very arbitary asumption that 6 is an uncommon ending digit, i guess 56 would fit pretty well. It is just not obvious enough for the vast majority to take it. I will need to be lucky that no one else thinks of the number."
2110,56,that's why
2111,56,"I am assuming 30,000 entries, based on nothing much other than the idea that 538 is popular but that a great many people skip the riddles because they are demanding and rigorous.  Entry to this one is easy and requires no hard work calculations, just a wild guess.  I assume people will cluster in the low numbers, but not too low.   I picked 56 as, just possibly, the lowest number that would exceed the other numbers chosen by others, assuming some clusteringing in the 20s and 30s.    I am imagining a trailing out of numbers in the 40s.     I am imagining a few scattered people will choose in the 50s and 70s, but that there will be skips above the 40s.   I chose 56 as a plausible right thin tail of the curve of the bell shaped distribution.   I am guessing lots of people in the 20s and 30s, the height of the bell curve.  (FYI I have edited and revised my number up from the mid 30s, deciding that a lot of other people would be strategic the way I am and that the cluster would take place in the high 20s and 30s.)"
2112,56,Uniqueness is my main concern. I'm going the conservative route with a high number. I think the winner will be less than 100

2126,57,I just randomly picked grothendieck’s prime
2127,57,My guess is that the first 50 or so positive integers will get submitted more than once each. 57 is one of those funny numbers that feels prime but isn't (3 x 19).
2128,57,No particular reason

2130,57,I feel it has a lot to do with how many people submit answers.  Everyone is trying to guess low so the lower the number more likely two someones  will try that number.   Need to go high enough that others dont pick it.
2131,57,Think about it!?
2132,57,Cause it's a stupid fucking number
2133,58,Why not?

2135,58,Because it's the right answer
2136,58,"Seems like a good number. Not prime, but doesn’t have too many factors either."
2137,58,Smallest doubled prime over 50
2138,58,"Strictly gut feel.  I assumed there would be some bias toward numbers between 1 and 25 (by eternal optimists), prime numbers (by overthinkers) and multiples of 5 (by quick-and-dirty entrants).  This number seemed low enough to have an actual chance of winning."
2139,58,"Wanted to guess a non-prime, non-odd number because those were the first numbers I thought of.  Intersection of the distribution of guesses and the probability that the number was not guessed is probably somewhere between 50 and 100 - depending on the number of replies.

2140,58,It is the most anonymous number below 100

2142,58,"I started by avoiding the numbers 1 - 31, as potential birth dates. That makes 34 a tempting choice but others are likely to think the same. It is necessary to think several steps ahead of others without getting too high and there is also a certain appeal about 2 x prime numbers, which are ugly enough not too attract too many people, but not as obvious to fellow competitors as prime numbers themselves."
2143,58,"I wanted to chose a number with a low number of factors, one that was even, and one that was not prime. 58 and 68 were my two choices, and I went with 58 due to it being lower."
2144,58,"I read something on Reddit about the least common jersey numbers in the NBA, and the lowest among those nobody ever wore was 58. I figured I couldn't go wrong by following some stranger's research without doing any fact checking. Plus, it seems like a good compromise between not putting any effort into this and putting way too much (which on a Saturday afternoon is anything more than spending 2 minutes on Google)."
2145,58,"About 1000 people entered the spy game, so I assume a similar number will enter this.  While most people will go for higher numbers, I'm guessing there will be a sizeable number that try to outsmart everyone by going low.  

There will assuredly be those who pick nice numbers; but there will be a lot who pick uncomfortable numbers on that logic.

So 58 - not too nice, not too messy, not too low, not too high (I hope)."

I know I created multiple accounts for the MLB ASB voting (5 times a day...psh, more like 100)(google + sign email trick.)  I'd be curious as to what the highest picked number is as well."
2155,59,"59 is not a round number, nor is it a number associated with anything notorious."
2156,59,"Well obviously people want low numbers, seems like the vast majority of people will be in the sub 50s, probably one of those will be unique (I have no good estimate of the number of people who will submit to this).

2180,61,That's the page number I'm on for the book I stopped reading to answer this.
2181,61,"Assume N=2000 submissions by others (which is about the number of submissions here for popular problems), with each submission picking a number from 1 to M=1000 independently and with probability of n being k/n (so k≈2/15).

If you pick n, the probability that no one else picked it is (1-k/n)^N. The probability that there are no unique numbers below it as approximately
product(P(m is not unique) for m = 1 to n-1), and P(m is not unique) = 1-N*k/m*(1-k/m)^(N-1).

Number 61 is reasonable in that the probability is close to maximal, though the probability that this entry wins is only roughly 2/300.

Python 3 code for estimated winning probability:

def winprob(N,M,n):
	k = 1/sum(1/n for n in range(1,M+1))
	prob = (1-k/n)**N
	for m in range(1,n):

2226,63,"There are a couple meta levels of decision making here, like the poison cup scene in Princess Bride. It seems obvious that the lowest numbers will be picked, so some much higher number should be chosen to afford a bare chance. But most people will figure that out, leaving the lower numbers unpicked. Yet many of them will also figure that out, and will pick some very low number. And many of them will take this one step further, and one further, again like the Princess Bride scene. At some point, as this is much more a social psychology problem than a math one, you just gotta pick a number.

Considering that with each iteration there were be fewer and fewer submissions ending at that iteration, and most players will stick to a relatively small number of iterations, I chose an ""even"" iteration (going high-low-high-low), ending with a relatively low number, but not as low as would be picked in the first low iteration (as some players will choose at every iteration, more numbers will be used up the further down the rabbit hole you go). So I chose a relatively low number, but ultimately it was based on feeling, and 63 is just a nice number, one digit being a factor of the other, the sum of the two being the square of one, with the product of the two numbers being a number whose individual digits also produces that square as a sum, as well as being double that square (36 would do all the same but felt too low).

2280,68,"I suspect the winning number will be lower than most people expect... however, I'm sure a number of people will make multiple low guesses to eliminate those numbers from contention. I'm hoping my guess will be just high enough to avoid those people."
2281,68,"It is not prime, and it seems fairly high enough to possibly be unique while still low enough to win."
2282,68,1 less than the children who will choose 69 :-)
2283,68,It just feels right.
2284,68,Teams in the NCAA tournament
2285,68,"I feel like 68 is nobody's favorite number but also it isn't prime, it isn't a multiple of anything interesting, just kind of a dull composite number.
I am most interested in the lowest integer that *nobody* submits."

2304,70,"I literally googled ""weirdest number"" and there is a Wikipedia page for ""Weird number."" I'm intrigued by this and eager to see what the winning number ends up being."
2305,70,"IDK, seems reasonable?"
2306,70,"Doing this right totally depends on the number of submitters, and what other submitters think is the number of submitters.   Given ~n submitters, I think you aim for a random number between 0 - [n/2] and hope for the best.  (And I think there will be enough smartasses trying something from 0-10.)  Estimating 300 entries, my random number generator came up with the above."
2307,70,69+1
2308,70,"I expect the distribution to be very high for N=1, followed by very flat for small integers as people try to get a little too ambitious.  It will likely then fall off gradually, with a great deal of noise and maybe even with a secondary peak from everybody thinking about ""not too high, not too low"" numbers.  I haven't thought about it that hard, but it seems likely that some number a little above where I expect that possible peak will likely be the smallest unique one.  I don't know how many submissions The Riddler gets each week - at least a few hundred, and maybe several thousand?  The lowest unpicked number is then virtually certainly less than 2000, and probably not bigger than 200.  Perhaps people will shy away from nice round numbers in that range and I'll be the only one to pick 70.  Seems more likely than going with, oh, 8 or something, and if I picked something like 344 I may very well have a unique number but it probably wouldn't be the lowest one."

2318,71,"Why not, seemed like a nice number (and prime!)  :)"
2319,71,An uninteresting low number
2320,71,Why not
2321,71,Random number...
2322,71,71 is  odd and a prime
2323,71,I figure a weird prime number will be less obvious to everyone trying to find a relatively low number that no one else will choose. 71 fits the bill.
2324,71,"People thinking strategically won't pick a low number (1-10), but a lot of people will combat that by thinking they're going to be the only one to pick a low number. People will combat that strategy by picking numbers slightly higher. This continues basically until everyone participating has picked a number, so the cut off for unique number realllly depends on how many responses you get. In the end, given the simplicity of picking a number, you'll probably get around 700 responses. A lot of people will choose 69 cause why not, then a lot of people will choose 70 because it's one higher. So 71."
2325,71,It's a nice number
2326,71,its so close to 69 that most people in the vicinity will just choose 69
2327,71,I dunno
2328,71,Just a random low guess
2329,71,Just strange enough to maybe be unique!
2330,71,"Because every pervert is going to pick 69, and every counter-pervert is going to pick 70, so I am then a counter-counter-pervert. Does that make me a pervert then?"

I chose the next number: 71. Hopefully the other 400 people that choose a number above 70 that's not a square or a multiple of 10 will go higher - possibly much higher.

2355,72,"I used an estimate of 2000 submissions and a normal-esque distribution starting from 0 to determine what the winning number would have been in various simulations. 72 was the lowest ""reliable"" winner. So in other words, it was a total guess :-)"
2356,72,Feels just random enough and just small enough
2357,72,"Assumes Riddler readers will submit primes, so I wanted a seriously composite number!"

2365,73,"Aribtrarily not small, but not too large"
2366,73,Why not?
2367,73,"Because it is a prime, emirp, star number, and a palindrome in octal/binary. Essentially it is just the best."
2368,73,Mmmm
2369,73,"Prime number; interesting prime number, but hopefully not _too_ interesting (73 = 21st prime, 7*3=21, 37 is 12th prime; also a binary palindrome, 1001001).  You usually get thousands of responses; I think that a number under 100, but not *too* far under 100, will likely win (though you'll get thousands of responses under 100)."
2370,73,Just a guess
2371,73,Picked out of thin air
2372,73,Figured at some point people would give up on numbers below 100 and try to be smart with higher numbers.

2374,73,Prime
2375,73,just a guess
2376,73,"538 typically gets a few thousand replies to it's riddler questions.  I figure a lot of entries will be in the thousands, but that a low prime number might sneak through.  73 might not be right, but I bet the logic is."
2377,73,it's a number?
2378,73,Seems like an arbitrary number so maybe others won't pick it
2379,73,"There seems to be very little justification in choosing one number rather than another, since success depends on avoiding numbers chosen by other people who are just as uncertain."
2380,73,"Gut feeling, but decided odd number has a better chance of winning (probably succumbing to groupthink and failing miserably in process)

2385,73,"It's my favorite number, and one not usually picked for, really, anything."
2386,73,I totally guessed
2387,73,I looked at a list of prime numbers and selected an non-obvious choice.
2388,73,"Kind of a random number, and it is prime. Thought the number was just high enough to be unique."
2389,73,I went largely on instinct
2390,73,"Theoretical answer is infinite, but reality is different. It is the opposite of the famous Keynes problem."
2391,73,Why not?
2392,73,Because 7 is an infrequently chosen random number and 3 is far away on both forms of keypad (less likely to be typed at random).
2393,73,"no body likes 73, I think it needs some love"
2394,73,It's not a number people really think of often
2395,73,David Blaine once said that 37 is the most commonly-selected two-digit number between 0 and 100.
2396,73,Prime numbers are less thought of.
2397,73,yes
2398,73,"Sincerely a guess, but I'm expecting a relatively steep drop-off in number choices and opted for a prime number for flare."
2399,74,"I think there's a temptation to go high, but it seems likely that there will be a couple of two digit numbers that are not picked so staying in that range feels like the right move."
2400,74,"There are about a 1000 entries per week, so anything below 50 did not seem feasible.  I also did not want to pick a commonly seen number (75, 100, etc).  74 seemed like a good guess to maximize my chances."
2401,74,My lucky number!

2411,75,"I think that a number below 100 will be unique. I think that people will be trying to pick numbers that ""sound"" unlikely, such as prime numbers. 75 is high enough that it's not one of the obvious lowest numbers that people might pick as a hail mary (1-20), but it's also a number that is low enough that there's an outside chance it might be the lowest unique number."
2412,75,"Very small numbers are subject to reverse psychology: ""no one will pick 1 because that would be too bold"". So at least one bold person will likely pick each of the ""very small"" numbers (say, those you can count on two hands) because they consider it unlikely that anyone else will. Above this limit, the number of players is more of a factor - the more players, the higher the likelihood that any given number will be picked at least once. Since the number of players is unknown, I have no rational criterion to decide, even if I had a plausible model. Numbers that aren't ""round"" (multiples of 5) are probably more likely to be chosen than numbers that are, as people try to avoid the ""obvious"" choices. So I chose a ""not very small"" multiple of 5."
2413,75,all
2414,76,I hope no one else picks this.
2415,76,"Not too low, not a number commonly associated with something else, but not unreasonably high."
2416,76,"Single digits are expected, 10-25 are less expected, but still high probability that someone would choose, 26-50 are in a similar boat, only less so, same with 51-75. 76 Seems like a high enough number that few would pick it, it has very few connections outside of math, and is fairly unimpressive."
2417,76,"I have no idea how to guess what other people will be entering, so I am just making a random guess."
2418,76,Because
2419,76,"I estimate that maybe 1000 people might enter.  I assume that numbers chosen might decay geometrically, such that 100 is 10% as likely to be chosen as 1.  This results in a geometric ratio of .977 and P(1)=.023.  Given 1000 people, and approximating a Poisson distribution for f(y), where y is the number of people out of 1000 choosing a number x, we have lambda (x)=23 * .977^^(x-1).  I then get f(1;x) from this lambda.  I then calculate the probability that x is the first unique = f(1;x)*P(all counts for less than x are not 1), where the second term is a product of independent probabilities ((1-(f(1;1))*(1-(f(1:2)) * ...).  Putting this into an Excel spreadsheet the probability of the first unique value maximizes at 76."

So I've gone through the obvious random-looking numbers (anything ending with a 7, anything prime, etc.) up to 100, as well as all the counter-intuitively obvious numbers that people will pick because they expect most to go for unusual ones (anything ending with a 0, any squares, cubes, etc.).

Then, once I'd determined 24 numbers to be ""obvious"" and 29 to be ""random-looking"", I got bored and picked something dull from the higher end of what remained (in the expectation that the lower numbers were more likely to be taken) - it looks neither obvious nor interesting, and I have more faith in the Riddler readership than to assume there'll be any unadventurous 32-to-33-year-olds or Orwell readers taking a punt on a significant date."

2531,90,I did some preliminary reading (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.0819.pdf) and guessed an even number close to a hundred.
2532,90,"I convinced myself that the optimal strategy for this is to choose from a distribution with P(X=n) strictly decreasing in n, nearly flat for small numbers but tapering off somewhere on the order of N/log(N), where N is the number of people playing.  If everyone plays with this strategy, then the number of people choosing each number up to N/log(N) will be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter log(N), giving a 1/e^log(N) = 1/N chance of any given number being chosen by exactly one person.  This is more or less what you want for a Nash equilibrium; i.e. in order for any given person to have no incentive to prefer larger or smaller numbers.  (My first instinct--coincidentally, from playing this game with Abijith himself some years ago--had been to taper around sqrt(N), but this makes unique choices much too unlikely.)

Once I was satisfied with my heuristic, I estimated (based on past Riddler Nation puzzles) that between 1000 and 2000 people will participate, so N/log(N) ~ 1500/7.3 ~ 200.  I picked a random number between 1 and 200.  This turned out to be 42, which felt too obvious, so I tried again and went with 90."

2535,91,"Benford's Law says that 9 is the least common first digit (and second digit) in naturally occurring sets of numbers.  But others are likely aware of Benford's Law and so would choose 99, or, anticipating others' similar choices would pick 98, 97, etc.  Since zero is the most common second digit under Benford's Law (and therefore unlikely to be picked by those aware of Benford's Law), it would be a good anticipatory choice as well, but, for that reason (and because it is the lowest number in the 90s), it is actually a bad choice.  Therefore 91 is the pick."

2546,91,"Super wild guess. Estimating somewhere between 10^3 and 10^4 submissions, we play a k-step game starting at 1, with the added complication that somebody's definitely going to guess 1, and of course somebody's definitely going to guess 2... so we're first looking for some point at which ""naive"" low guesses taper off and ""informed"" low guesses begin. Then we want to move forward just far enough to exploit a stochastic gap. I feel like it has to be less than 10^2 even with 10^4 guesses. But there are mini k-step games occurring around certain numbers like 99. After feeling it out it just feels like a 91."

2639,106,"I looked at how many answers were submitted for the ""Battles for Riddler Nation"" (the challenge that I knew the number of participants was released for), and they had around 1,000-1,500 submissions. That was a much higher effort challenge, so I assume we'll have about 5,000 submissions.

I bet most of those people (we'll say 4,000) want to pick a number 100 or below. That would mean the ""average"" number 100 or below is selected 40 times. I don't like my odds of finding a unique one.

I'll go with something 100-200, but it can't be something too ""obvious"" like 100 or 150 or something too ""obscure"" like 137 or 113. I also of course want to pick something fairly low if given the choice.

Many, maybe as much as a quarter, will be very very low, due to human nature. The goal then, is to pick a number just past the point where there is statistical overlap of 3000 people. While some will guess as high as 400 or so, it will be strongly weighted low. 108 seems reasonably low, while still hopefully missing out on any psychological fondness."

I'm guessing that people won't want to pick numbers ending in 5 or 0 since those aren't as ""random."" Thus, {110, 115, 120} seem like decent numbers to choose.

2740,116,"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/most-popular-numbers-grapes-of-math/

But I assume someone else read this.  So I added +6."
2741,116,"I think it's likely that numbers less than 100 will be taken, so I selected a number somewhat larger than 100."
2742,116,"The Riddler from a couple of weeks ago on the coffee consumption had 1,538 entries. Assuming a similar number of entries, the lowest unique integer will be below this number."
2743,116,"I'm guessing numbers under 100 will be popular, and I like the number 16, so I added that to 100."
2744,116,"First I ran some simulations and concluded the winning number would almost certainly be lower than 300, likely lower than 200, and quite possibly lower than 100. I would have felt very optimistic about the chances of the winning number being lower than 100, except that a) such numbers have a high chance of being populated by trolls and b) some people might submit personally important numbers, like ages or birth years, which would usually be lower than 100. 

On the assumption that the winner might be lower than 100 anyway, I challenged myself to intuitively pick two-digit numbers that other people wouldn't think of. My answers were a) 94 and b) 76.

Next I looked at the English Wikipedia's page view stats, running from April through July this year, for all numbers from 38 through 140, for both [X] and [X (number)], for objective data on which numbers people really didn't think about. The results for these two data sets were somewhat different; the X set suggested 38, 46, 57, 59, 82, 83, 84, 92 and 94 as little-viewed compared to neighbors (my first intuitive pick, 94, led the whole field) and implied that numbers higher than 100 would be bad, while the X (number) set was much better for three-digit numbers and offered 106, 116, 104 and (below 100) 54, 68, 71, 74, 76 and 94. I was not surprised that even numbers (other than those ending in 0) were generally less popular in both data sets; odd numbers, by their very oddness, have a certain appeal.

Combining the two data sets, I ""should"" have picked one of my two intuitive picks, 94 or 76, because they both fared really well in the combined test. But I rejected them precisely because they were my intuitive picks, and might therefore be other people's intuitive picks as well. I rejected 74 (another number that survived both tests well) because I use it so much otherwise that it seemed way too fitting to be my answer. I rejected numbers lower than 70 as too low, 82/83/84 due to bad X (number) scores, and 104 and 106 as being too close to 100; which left 116 as the overall winner. (I never seriously considered any number higher than 116; it's certainly possible, perhaps even likely, that such a number will win; but no one number suggested itself, and with so many candidates it would be a total crapshoot.) I am almost certainly overthinking, but what else could I do? The choice of 116 shows my high level of confidence in trolls; if I thought all answers would come from good-faith contestants I would probably have picked a two-digit number."

2764,117,"I figured from the hundreds of individuals that submit an answer, the majority would try to stick to the double digits, however there would also be those who try to jump out into the hundreds place. Knowing they'd likely stick to numbers that sound good to the ear, and look good on paper, I picked the number 117 because 7 is far from 1 when counting to ten, and often just thinking about numbers in the 100's, people like to make them gradually go up, like 135, or 124, but they usually don't repeat themselves. 117 is also a number that is not very easily divisible, only a vast amount of numbers people greatly dislike, including

3, 9, 13, and 39, each number of which people do not enjoy working with (at least I don't)"

2768,117,"First 100 probably covered by ""low guessers"" banking on a number that just gets missed or hoping they are just lucky getting one nobody else submits. The frequency of duplicates probably drops off around 100 except for ""significant"" numbers (like 100, 101, 144, etc). I picked 117 because it's close to that drop off but not special in any way."

2777,118,"Low-ish, seems like a number not too many people will pick"
2778,118,"Randomly - Can you please do a graphic showing the results you get from this? I think it would be pretty cool, especially if there were any surprisingly high numbers chosen twice."
2779,118,Seems right
2780,118,Figured it would have to be three digits. Went for low three digits.
2781,118,Not 17
2782,118,I figured a random three digit number is the least likely to be picked.
2783,118,Feeling it.
2784,118,"This is a second guess, following the same principles as the first, that odd and relatively high numbers will be the normal guess, but with the opportunity to guess multiple times, I believe a slightly higher guess is needed."

I suppose I could have gone into trying to figure out how many viewers there are of the 538 site and how many people typically answer one of these questions, but that's too much work for a Friday.  So I'm ballparking in it. To be sure, there's going to be a whole lot of luck in being correct anyway. 

It's a little like a prisoner's dilemma game with a heck of a lot of prisoners, yes?  I was also considering choosing the number 7."

2792,119,"I figured that in a popular contest like this, all numbers 1-100 would be chosen by other people. After determining that my number would start with a ""1"" in the hundreds position, I picked a random number to follow. ""19"" is prime, and generally felt uncommon enough to me. Hence, 119."
2793,119,who else would pick 119?
2794,119,"Mostly a hunch, but a rough guess on how many people would submit (a few hundred to a few thousand likely, assuming one entry per person) so unlikely the answer will be a single or double digit number as most unique numbers will probably be chosen.  Then if likely that a 3-4 digit number will the correct answer, And knowing that to get a lower number the leading digits need to be lower than average (1 is lower than 5 is lower than 9). Guess I can try for a low 3 digit number (aggressive strategy) so 1XX, with the second number not the lowest (slightly less aggressive) (not 0) so 11X , and last number high (conservative) in an attepmt to try and out maneuver similar strategies with 110-118,...so i pick 119. 

PS -  this is probably properly defined by ""positive integer"" , but I consider an answer such as 007 the same as 7, and therefore would not be unique. Or,  to put int another way, no  amount of leading zeros would change the uniqueness of the answer."

Final assumption, majority of picks will be odd numbers given that odd numbers ""feel"" less likely to be picked."
2826,124,"When asked to choose a random number, people tend to go for prime numbers - so I went for an even number. I kind of suspect that the number will be much lower than this (possibly even 2, because who would assume no one else would pick 2?) but it's hard to know how high the number will be without knowing how many people typically respond to the Riddler.

Applying Zipf's law, a possible distribution of guesses for each number can be estimated. From this distribution, we can select the smallest number likely to be unique. This number can be adjusted slightly to increase likelihood of uniqueness (128->126 powers of two might be common guesses)."
2837,126,Well it would've been a lot easier to guess a number if I knew how many replies there were going to be. That being said I have seen a few of your problems have had a bunch entries so I decided to go with a number that's reasonably small but not too small

2853,128,I won that coffee game
2854,128,"There were about 1000 participants in riddler nation last time. Assuming about twice the number submit to this puzzle, I'd say 2,000 answers are likely. That's too many to consider common popular and unpopular numbers, because someone's bound to try them. On the other hand, it's also too few for a completely random model to be informative. If we assumed everyone guessed a random number between 1 and 500, the mean smallest guess is 4!

I will assume that everything between 1 and 100 is a minefield - and that a small portion of people like myself are uncomfortable sitting too close to it as well. 128 seems to be the perfect combination of timidity (in avoiding the minefield and the area behind it) and boldness (in choosing a relatively popular number)."
2855,129,Reasonably low. And I figure that there are probably at least two people willing to take the Price is Right approach and bid $1.
2856,129,"I guessed that you will have two camps: the cheeky (1 or 10), the safe (10,000 and up), and the ""inbetweeners"" (100-10000). I gambled low, betting that there aren't that many people who will choose my same ""random"" number in the mid 100's."
2857,129,"I imagine that all single and double-digit integers would be obvious risks by other users.  Similarly, low-100 numbers are close enough to double-digit integers that more savvy users might try to pick one of those, but I believe there are enough users such that many will have the same thought.  129 seems distant enough that someone else might not guess it.  I'll have to wait and see."

2866,129,"From the graph on the ""who drinks the most coffee"" puzzle I know there's going to be around 1,000 submissions... So I think it's likely that every number from 1 to 100 will be picked twice.

I can't expect a uniform distribution, as people will lean toward the lower numbers, but in simulating a uniform distribution with 1000 picks from 1 to 200, I regularly get a few unique numbers, so I think the winning number will be in the low 100's, or high double digits.

I generated a random number between 100 and 150 and got 129. Fingers crossed!"

So it has to be above 100 and no too unique, but not too not unique. 148 is high, granted, but it's not special.

3080,179,"I ultimately used Benford's Law to calculate probabilistic weights for a random sample of integers, and combined those weights with a few assumptions to run many simulations to see what number, on average, ends up as the lowest unique integer. First, I assumed nobody would guess a number above 1000, as there will likely be on the order of 1000-10000 participants which essentially guarantees that the winning number will be 3 digits at most. Second, I assumed there was no chance that a single digit number will end up being the lowest, so I did not considering those in my simulations. 

I also included a pair of adjustable parameters in my simulation: the total number of guesses, and the percentage of guesses that are 2 digit numbers. The percentage of 2 digit guesses can be inferred from Benford's Law, but I suspected that the fraction of 2 digit guesses will be somewhat higher than ""random"" given that everyone is trying to get the lowest unique integer. 

After running 1000 simulations for each pair of parameters (number of total guesses, ranging from 1000 to 5000, and fraction of guesses as 2 digit numbers, ranging from 10% to 99%), the average lowest unique integer ranges from 35 for 1000 participants, to 253 for 5000 participants.

Not surprisingly, if over ~60% of the guesses are two digit numbers, the lowest unique integer quickly settles into a value in the low 100s, almost regardless of the number of guesses, as there are significantly fewer guesses over 100 in this case. Hence, my final guess was made by assuming that somewhere between the ~30% (as predicted by Benford's Law) and ~60% (the point at which the answer is in the always in the low 100s) will guess a two digit number - or 45%. I'm also guessing that around 4,000 people will participate, given that ~1,500 participated in the original ""Battle For Riddler Nation,"" and this one requires significantly less effort, hence more participants. The average lowest unique positive integer for 45% 2-digit guesses and 4,000 total participants, after 1000 simulations, comes out to be ~180, which I went down to 179 to have a slightly less ""neat"" answer.

I would be curious, given the true number of 2-digit guesses and total number of participants, how close this strategy of using Benford's Law for choosing probabilistic weights comes to actually predicting the answer..."

So, among the 3 digit numbers, it is highly unlikely that all of them will be selected, so to me the question is - what is the smallest 3 digit number that won't be selected.

Assuming 1500 entries, assuming a Zipf distribution, the number choosing 1 would be 1500/7.89 ~ 190.
The Zipf distribution is: n, n/2, n/3, n/4, n/5, n/6, ... (i.e the harmonic series).
The 7.89 is the sum of the harmonic series out to 1500.
So the expected value of the number choosing a particular interger drops to 1 at about 190.
So the lowest unused number is probably around there.

If we think of this as an n person zero sum game, then it depends on whether n is even or odd.
If n is odd (= 2*k + ), then any alliance of k + 1 players can force a win by choosing all the numbers from 1 to k + 1.  At least 1 of them must be unique.
If n is even (= 2*k), then any alliance of k players can force a tie by choosing all the numbers from 1 to k.  At least 1 of them must be unique, unless the other k players also choose all the numbers from 1 to k.

The possible valid numbers to chose are all integers [1,infinity).

This looks like a form of the Birthday Problem, but instead of determining the number of people needed to get a match, I need to figure out how high the integers would need to be to avoid a match with a known group of people.

The problem with that, however, is there won't be an equal distribution since the goal is to be the lowest unique integer. People will avoid the lowest numbers (1-20?) because they will assume a large group will select the lowest. However, there will also be a large group that will assume that since everyone else is avoiding the lowest numbers, they will choose those low numbers in hopes that they are the only one to do so.

While some will chose their ""lucky"" numbers, others will guess numbers that feel ""off"" or ""unbalanced."" The idea being that numbers that people ascribe with those unpleasant feelings are numbers that people don't normally pick when asked to choose a number at random. Without taking the time to look up research or data on the subject, I would hypothesize that often those ""uncomfortable"" numbers are more likely to be prime numbers.

So I need to find a number as low as I can go whose probability to be chosen by someone else in a group of 1500-1600 is hopefully less than 0.5, but also isn't a prime number, and I probably want to avoid numbers that feel too ""balanced"" which I'll guess are numbers that end in 5, 0, or have repeating values (22,33,44).

I'm sure somewhere there is an optimum game theory method to try that I don't know, but maybe the whole point of this is to get data for a game theory experiment.

In the end, I chose 253. I don't know exactly how to figure the probability of a match, but 253 is high, but the number of entrants means I might have to guess kind of high. It's a composite number to avoid anyone guessing on the primes, but its factors are none of the single digit primes so it still has a slight feel of being ""off."""
3224,254,"254 is a candidate for the lowest boring number (see the interesting number paradox) because it is the lowest number to not have its own Wikipedia entry. The number's inherit boringness raises its odds of being unique, and among this set of boring numbers, it has the lowest value."
3225,254,"According to the Wikipedia page ""Interesting number paradox"", 254 is the lowest number to not have its own Wikipedia page."

I ran simulations on 1538 submissions (the same number as the last time you ran a submit-a-number contest) and at 259 the odds of every number being taken <= 259 were about 50/50. This assumes that everyone picking is using a uniform distribution between 0 and 259. Picking 259 specifically doesn't make a lot of sense frankly, but I had to pick something."
3234,259,It feels lucky!
3235,259,"assuming 1,000 or so submissions, and i like this number"
3236,259,random number generator
3237,260,"Assuming the riddler receives 1000 submissions on average, in an ideal case each person knows what the lowest number submitted was. Thus the first person would submit a 1, second person knowing a 1 had already been submitted would submit a 2 and so on. If everyone is assuming 1-100 has been submitted in duplicate then 800 guesses are left. I think it is reasonable that numbers 1-100 may be guessed more than two times. This could leave 700 people. Assuming people are aware of the likelihood of double guesses I am airing on people starting to aim lower and lower. My gut left me with something in the 200-300 range."

3242,264,"When asked to pick a random number, most people go odd. They also pick numbers which seem to not have many  divisors. A number with 3 even digits, and which seems like it would divide easily (but doesn't) should be more rarely picked."
3243,264,Why not
3244,266,"It is a strange fact of reality that 37, 73 etc will be chosen oddly much.  My strategy is to thus to avoid 3s and 7s.  I estimate that ~3-5k will participate (based on the castle thing I looked back on - this is a lot easier so I imagine more guesses), but a lot of these will just clump up on gimmicky answers.  Even among the few thousands trying to be random, a lot will pick numbers way too high/low.  I imagine everything below 200 will be thoroughly peppered.  My first instinct was to pick something in the 200s, but that is most certainly a bad idea, that being said whatever.  Also I avoid 8s, 9s, ascending/descending sequences.  I doubt 0s will to be popular, but repeating digits will be even less so."

3281,307,"With hundreds, not to say thousands of entries it seemed likely to me  that the smallest unique number would not be less than 100, and not greater than 1000. I thought a prime number better than a composite number because there is no smaller factor to suggest it. So I decided to choose the lowest prime greater than 300, which is 307. Greater than 400 seemed too high to me. I could not even begin to imagine a systematic or logical way to go about this."

3326,379,"Chose a number on the 3 digit due to the fact that all the two digits numbers have a fairly high chance of been selected, not using a number with any special connotation to diminish the chance of it been used. Picked a random number on the low 3 digits."

I think there's a good shot the winning number is therefore between 100 and 500, and, although I could try to outsmart everyone and pick an ""uncommon"" number, I think it's more likely that I'd just arrive closer to everyone else. So I used a random number generator. The first one was 277, which I discarded because 7 is often considered to be the most ""random"" number and I have a suspicion that people will be predisposed to pick it.

3477,812,"I set up a randomization in Excel that would produce a number at random between 1 and 3,162, heavily weighted toward three-digit numbers.  Specifically, I generated four random numbers between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 2.5 and 3.5, which served as four different exponents for the number 10.  Those four random numbers of different orders of magnitude were chosen between at frequencies 0.4%, 2.0%, 96.4%, and 1.2%.  My reasoning for including any chance of a low number is the others are also likely to avoid picking a low number.  If everyone else held back, then the one person who boldly picked one would take the cake.  Of course it's hard to imagine everyone else actually holding back, so I targeted that as a low probability.  Exactly how low is just a guess.  It would be helpful in modeling this to know how many submissions come in per week, and that may have been mentioned in an earlier puzzle but I don't remember that number.  Finally, we were asked to make integer submissions, so I rounded to the nearest integer."

3527,1220,just because
3528,1237,I asked WolframAlpha for a random integer between 1000 and 2000.
3529,1238,I did a bunch of work on the other puzzle and just decided to throw a number out.
3530,1247,"If 100,000 people submit numbers, a large fraction of people just focus on small numbers, say 50 percent just try it for fun and pick a number like one for example, there will be a large amount of numbers 100 and below down to one (assuming nobody makes the mistake of putting a fraction or a negative number) that are chosen several hundred times or even more. Later on as you get into the triple digits, I theorize that numbers will be picked a lot less often, possibly around 30 times per number in that range. If you multiply 30 times 900, (the amount of triple digit numbers there are) you'll get 27,000 which leaves us with 23,000 more estimates. Since there are a lot more four digit numbers than there are numbers that are triple digits and below down to one, one should assume the numbers will be spread out by a factor of. Without getting into the nitty gritty of it, the numbers are approximately 33.48 times more spread out if about 90 percent of the people who aren't choosing a number between one and 999 are choosing a four digit number which has the potential of being a very high estimate in regards of people picking four digit numbers in comparison to five digit numbers six digit number, etc. Another important factor to consider is ""lucky"" and trendy numbers. In order to pick a right number, it makes sense to avoid numbers that have only even digits or only odd digits. It also makes sense to avoid numbers such as 1492 which was the year Columbus ""discovered"" America or 1945 when WWII ended. It also doesn't make sense to pick a ""birthday"" number such as 1267 which can translate to 1/2/67. I start to disregard this if it's not a common birthday such as a number that ends with a 19 due to the fact that I highly doubt many people of an age that can be considered as ""elderly"" are trying to complete this riddle. It's logical as a result to pick a number that ends with 11 to 57. I would include 07 to 10 but I won't use an even number for reasons stated later and I won't use a zero as my third digit for reasons also stated later. That leaves the door open for picking a number in the 1000s though I wouldn't recommend that for reasons mentioned later. I also want to avoid numbers like 1411 or 1333 because they may be tempting to choose due to human psychology as a result of there repetitiveness. Other highly compelling numbers that may be tempting to choose are numbers in the 1000-1199 area because it sits right in the early 1000s and it makes a ton of sense that people will try to game the system and choose an integer in this range. After all, what most people are likely thinking in this range is that mostpeople are picking triple digit numbers, why not pick a relatively small four digit number. The reason to not pick something in the 1100s though is that it has two ones slot start. That, I believe, is a recipe for disaster due to the fact that is begins with two ones. I don't like even numbers because I believe they are much more likely to be chosen over odds and I also don't want a zero as my third digit as mentioned earlier because I believe those numbers are at risk of the same fate as numbers in the 1000s. This leads to a logical idea that my number will be an odd number between 1 and 1257. Another consideration is to avoid numbers that you can count forward or backward next to each other such as 1219 which violates this rule twice. The same rule goes for consecutive numbers which is precisely why I ruled out numbers in the 1100s before. I will start with 12 though because I believe there is a solid chance people don't chose a number that starts with 12 anyway. One of my final considerations thing I want to avoid before picking my magical number is to avoid anything that is a ""special"" number. This could mean and it gets picked 5 times for that very reason. There aren't any numbers that violate this rule that don't violate at least one of the other rules and frankly, there are probably many rules that I have listed here that are irrelevant to this problem because at least one of the other rules rules a number out every time that rule takes effect. The very final criteria I have is for the very few people who have thought about this riddle and have gotten number ranges, no matter how they got there, that are very similar to mine. We now know that my range must be 1241-1257 ruling out the numbers 1243, 1245, and 1255. This effectively gives me the options 1241, 1247, 1249, 1253, and 1257. If four people including myself have zeroed it down to options that are freakishly similar to mine out of the 100,000 people doing this they might feel compelled to pick the lowest but be aware that the other three theoretical members in this group are thinking the same thing. I believe one of these guys go for it and takes the win but I can't go for it as well or I wouldn't be solving the riddle either. The best thing to hope for here is somebody to randomly write 1241 here and I'm not sure how likely that is to happen. The more likely scenario is two or more in this group of four people like this number too and take it as a result of the other thinking it's free to take. If I strategisize long enough , I might be thought of as forced to pick the higher number as not to pick the same at 1247 but for the sake of getting the lower number, I'm just going to take it and call it my answer."

My number is written using LaTeX, and can be properly rendered that way.

I started with an 8 for making it different. I also decided to not just keep adding even more, even though there's not a text limit in the field. It's already pretty damn low."
3651,0.999...,"The number above, affectionately known as Infininine, is exactly equal to 1, the lowest positive integer.  But it *is* a unique number, it *is* an integer, and it *isn't* 1 . It just happens to equal to 1, the way something like j**4 also = 1; however, j**4 isn't a number, but an expression, so it would be disqualified.  I'm also betting that no one else will submit Infininine as an answer, of course.
