# What is this?

`Rdatasets` is a collection of 2127 datasets which were originally
distributed alongside the statistical software environment `R` and some
of its add-on packages. The goal is to make these data more broadly
accessible for teaching and statistical software development.

# What is included?

The list of available datasets (csv and docs) is available here:

  - [HTML
    index](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html)
  - [CSV
    index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/master/datasets.csv)

On the github repository you will also find the scripts I use to scrape
data and update the website.

# Adding data

Rdatasets only includes data from packages published on the CRAN
repository. Please open an issue on the Github repository if you would
like me to add data from a new package.

# License

The code in this repository is licensed under GPL-3.

I believe that the R documentation which I copied to the Rdatasets html
folder is licensed under GPL. You will find a copy of the GPL in the
Rdatasets github repository.

I made a good faith effort to determine the license under which the
actual data (i.e. rows/columns of numbers) were distributed, but I was
unable to find a definitive answer. My understanding is that these
datasets are free to re-distribute. However, if you own the rights to
data that are included here and you object to their inclusion in
Rdatasets, send me an email at <vincent.arel-bundock@umontreal.ca>. I
will promptly remove the data in question and will make sure that all
traces are erased from the git revision history.
