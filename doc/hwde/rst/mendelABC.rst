      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``mendel3`` data frame has 27 rows and 4 columns. Data are
      from Mendel (1886), and are reproduced in Fisher (1936) and Weir
      (1996).

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(mendelABC)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      seedshape
         Factor with levels: ``AA``, ``Aa`` and ``aa``

      cotylcolor
         Factor with levels: ``BB``, ``Bb`` and ``bb``

      coatcolor
         Factor with levels: ``CC``, ``Cc`` and ``cc``

      Observed
         a numeric vector that holds the frequencies.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data are reviewed in detail in Fisher (1936). For a brief
      discussion, and references to work that revisits Fisher's
      conclusions, see Weir (1996).
