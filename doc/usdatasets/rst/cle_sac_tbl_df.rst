      The dataset name has been changed to 'cle_sac_tbl_df' to avoid
      confusion with other packages in the R ecosystem from which
      datasets have been sourced. This naming convention helps
      distinguish this dataset as part of the 'usdatasets' package and
      assists users in identifying its specific characteristics. The
      suffix 'tbl_df' identifies the dataset as a tibble. The original
      content of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
