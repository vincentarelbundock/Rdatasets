      The dataset name has been changed to 'oscars_tbl_df' to avoid
      confusion with other packages in the R ecosystem. This naming
      convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
      'usdatasets' package and identifies it as a tibble. The original
      content of the dataset has not been modified.
