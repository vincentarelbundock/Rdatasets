      The dataset name has been changed to 'airlines_tbl_df' to avoid
      confusion with other packages in the R ecosystem. This naming
      convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
      'usdatasets' package and assists users in identifying its specific
      characteristics. The suffix 'tbl_df' identifies the dataset as a
      tibble, helping to differentiate it from other datasets within the
      package. The original content of the dataset has not been modified
      in any way.
