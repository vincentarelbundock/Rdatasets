      The dataset name has been changed to 'state_name_character' to
      avoid confusion with other packages in the R ecosystem. This
      naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
      'usdatasets' package and identifies it as a character vector. The
      original content of the dataset has not been modified.
