         algorithms based on MNIST data
         :name: useful-example-for-illustrating-machine-learning-algorithms-based-on-mnist-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      We only include a randomly selected set of 2s and 7s along with
      the two predictors based on the proportion of dark pixels in the
      upper left and lower right quadrants respectively. The dataset is
      divided into training and test sets.

      .. rubric:: Usage

      ::

         mnist_27

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      An object of class ``list``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      -  train. A data frame containing training data: labels and
         predictors.

      -  test. A data frame containing test data: labels and predictors.

      -  index_train. The index of the original mnist training data used
         for the training set.

      -  index_test. The index of the original mnist test data used for
         the test set.

      -  true_p. A ``data.frame`` containing the two predictors ``x_1``
         and ``x_2`` and the conditional probability of being a 7 for
         ``x_1``, ``x_2``.
