      The original data source is the Education Longitudinal Study of
      2002. To deal with the issue on individually identifiable
      information, we generated hypothetical student-level data using a
      multiple imputation method. The Education Longitudinal Study of
      2002 used a two-stage sample selection process. First, a national
      sample of schools was selected using stratified probability
      proportional to size (PPS), and school contacting resulted in
      1,221 eligible public, Catholic, and other private schools from a
      population of approximately 27,000 schools containing 10th grade
      students. Of the eligible schools, 752 participated in the study.
      In the second stage of sample selection, a sample of approximately
      26 sophomores, from within each of the participating public and
      private schools was selected. Each school was asked to provide a
      list of 10th grade students, and quality assurance (QA) checks
      were performed on each list that was received.
