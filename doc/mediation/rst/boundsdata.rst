      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A random subsample of the simulated data used in Imai, Tingley,
      and Yamamoto (2012). The data contains 1000 rows and 7 columns
      with no missing values.

      A data frame containing the following variables, which are
      interpreted as results from a hypothetical randomized trial. See
      the source for a full description.

      out:
         The binary outcome variable under the parallel design.

      out.enc:
         The binary outcome variable under the parallel encouragement
         design.

      med:
         The binary mediator under the parallel design.

      med.enc:
         The binary mediator under the parallel encouragement design.

      ttt:
         The binary treatment variable.

      manip:
         The design indicator, or the variable indicating whether the
         mediator is manipulated under the parallel design.

      enc:
         The trichotomous encouragement variable under the parallel
         encouragement design. Equals 0 if subject received no
         encouragement; 1 if encouraged for the mediator value of 1; and
         -1 if encouraged for the mediator value of 0.

      .. rubric:: Details

      Conditioning on 'manip' = 0 will simulate a randomized trial under
      the single experiment design, where 'out' and 'med' equal observed
      outcome and mediator values, respectively.

      Unconditionally, using 'out', 'med', 'ttt' and 'manip' will
      simulate an experiment under the parallel design.

      The 'out.enc' and 'med.enc' variables represent the outcome and
      mediator values observed when subjects received the encouragement
      indicated in 'enc'. Therefore, using 'out.enc', 'med.enc', 'ttt'
      and 'enc' will simulate an experiment under the parallel
      encouragement design.

      Note that all the observed responses are generated from an
      underlying distribution of potential outcomes and mediators (not
      shown in this dataset) satisfying the assumptions described in
      Imai, Tingley and Yamamoto (2012). The full simulation code is
      available as a companion replication archive for the article.
