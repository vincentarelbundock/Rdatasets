      A data frame containing the following variables, which are
      interpreted as results from a hypothetical randomized trial
      employing the crossover encouragement design.

      T1:
         The binary treatment indicator in the first stage.

      M1:
         The binary mediator variable recorded in the first stage.

      Y1:
         The binary outcome variable recorded in the first stage.

      T2:
         The binary treatment in the second stage. Equal to 1 - T1 by
         design.

      Z:
         The binary encouragement indicator for the second stage.

      M2:
         The binary mediator recorded in the second stage.

      Y2:
         The binary outcome recorded in the second stage.

      Note that all the observed responses are generated from an
      underlying distribution of potential outcomes and mediators (not
      shown in this dataset) satisfying the assumptions described in
      Imai, Tingley and Yamamoto (2012).
