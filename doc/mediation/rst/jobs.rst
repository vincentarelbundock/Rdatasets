      Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II). JOBS II is a randomized
      field experiment that investigates the efficacy of a job
      trainingintervention on unemployed workers. The program is
      designed to not only increase reemploymentamong the unemployed but
      also enhance the mental health of the job seekers. In the JOBS
      IIfield experiment, 1,801 unemployed workers received a
      pre-screening questionnaire and were thenrandomly assigned to
      treatment and control groups. Those in the treatment group
      participatedin job-skills workshops. In the workshops, respondents
      learned job-search skills and coping strategiesfor dealing with
      setbacks in the job-search process. Those in the control condition
      receiveda booklet describing job-search tips. In follow-up
      interviews, the two key outcome variables weremeasured; a
      continuous measure of depressive symptoms based on the Hopkins
      Symptom Checklist,and a binary variable, representing whether the
      respondent had become employed.
