<h2>Hypothetical student-level data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The original data source is the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. To deal
with the issue on individually identifiable information, we generated 
hypothetical student-level data using a multiple imputation method. The 
Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 used a two-stage sample selection 
process. First, a national sample of schools was selected using stratified 
probability proportional to size (PPS), and school contacting resulted in 
1,221 eligible public, Catholic, and other private schools from a population 
of approximately 27,000 schools containing 10th grade students. Of the 
eligible schools, 752 participated in the study. In the second stage of 
sample selection, a sample of approximately 26 sophomores, from within each 
of the participating public and private schools was selected. Each school was
asked to provide a list of 10th grade students, and quality assurance (QA) 
checks were performed on each list that was received.
