<h2>JOBS II data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II). JOBS II is a randomized field 
experiment that investigates the efficacy of a job trainingintervention on 
unemployed workers. The program is designed to not only increase 
reemploymentamong the unemployed but also enhance the mental health of the 
job seekers. In the JOBS IIfield experiment, 1,801 unemployed workers 
received a pre-screening questionnaire and were thenrandomly assigned to 
treatment and control groups. Those in the treatment group participatedin 
job-skills workshops. In the workshops, respondents learned job-search skills
and coping strategiesfor dealing with setbacks in the job-search process. 
Those in the control condition receiveda booklet describing job-search tips. 
In follow-up interviews, the two key outcome variables weremeasured; a 
continuous measure of depressive symptoms based on the Hopkins Symptom 
Checklist,and a binary variable, representing whether the respondent had 
become employed.
