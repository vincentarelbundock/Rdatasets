<h2>Influence of a Good Mood on Helpfulness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This study investigated whether finding a coin influenced a person's
likelihood of mailing a sealed but addressed letter that appeared to have
been accidentally left in a conspicuous place. Several variables were
collected during the experiment, including two randomized variables of
whether there was a coin to be found and whether the letter already had a
stamp on it.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
mail_me
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 42 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>stamped</dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>no</code> <code>yes</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>found_coin</dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>coin</code> <code>no_coin</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>gender</dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>female</code> <code>male</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>mailed_letter</dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>no</code> <code>yes</code></p>
</dd> </dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The precise context was in a phone booth (this study is from the 1970s!),
where a person who entered a phone booth would find a dime in the phone
tray, which would be sufficient to pay for their phone call. There was also
a letter next to the phone, which sometimes had a stamp on it.
