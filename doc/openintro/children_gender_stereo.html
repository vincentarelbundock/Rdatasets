<h2>Gender Stereotypes in 5-7 year old Children</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Stereotypes are common, but at what age do they start? This study
investigates stereotypes in young children aged 5-7 years old. There are
four studies reported in the paper, and all four data sets are provided here.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>children_gender_stereo
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data object is more unusual than most. It is a list of 4 data
frames. The four data frames correspond to the data used in Studies 1-4 of
the referenced paper, and these data frames each have variables (columns)
that are among the following:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>subject</dt><dd><p>Subject ID. Note that Subject 1 in the first data frame
(data set) does <b>not</b> correspond to Subject 1 in the second data frame.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gender</dt><dd><p>Gender of the subject.</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt><dd><p>Age of the subject, in years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>trait</dt><dd><p>The trait that the children were making a judgement about,
which was either <code>nice</code> or <code>smart</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>target</dt><dd><p>The age group of the people the children were making judgements
about (as being either nice or smart): <code>children</code> or <code>adults</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stereotype</dt><dd><p>The proportion of trials where the child picked a gender
target that matched the trait that was the same as the gender of the child.
For example, suppose we had 18 pictures, where each picture showed 2 men and
2 women (and a different set of people in each photo). Then if we asked a
boy to pick the person in each picture who they believed to be really smart,
this <code>stereotype</code> variable would report the fraction of pictures where
the boy picked a man. When a girl reviews the photos, then this
<code>stereotype</code> variable reports the fraction of photos where she picked
a woman. That is, this variable differs in meaning depending on the gender
of the child. (This variable design is a little confusing, but it is useful
when analyzing the data.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>high_achieve_caution</dt><dd><p>The proportion of trials where the child said
that children of their own gender were high-achieving in school.</p>
</dd>
<dt>interest</dt><dd><p>Average score that measured the interest of the child in
the game.</p>
</dd>
<dt>difference</dt><dd><p>A difference score between the interest of the child in
the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; game and their interest in the &ldquo;try-hard&rdquo; game.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The structure of the data object is a little unusual, so we recommend
reviewing the Examples section before starting your analysis.

<p>Thank you to Nicholas Horton for pointing us to this study and the data!

<p>Most of the results in the paper can be reproduced using the data provided
here.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
# This data set is a little funny to work with.
# If wanting to review the data for a study, we
# recommend first assigning the corresponding
# data frame to a new variable. For instance,
# below we assign the second study's data to an
# object called `d` (d is for data!).
