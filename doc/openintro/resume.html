<h2>Which resume attributes drive job callbacks?</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This experiment data comes from a study that sought to understand the
influence of race and gender on job application callback rates. The study
monitored job postings in Boston and Chicago for several months during 2001
and 2002 and used this to build up a set of test cases. Over this time
period, the researchers randomly generating resumes to go out to a job
posting, such as years of experience and education details, to create a
realistic-looking resume. They then randomly assigned a name to the resume
that would communicate the applicant's gender and race. The first names
chosen for the study were selected so that the names would predominantly be
recognized as belonging to black or white individuals. For example, Lakisha
was a name that their survey indicated would be interpreted as a black
woman, while Greg was a name that would generally be interpreted to be
associated with a white male.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Because this is an experiment, where the race and gender attributes are
being randomly assigned to the resumes, we can conclude that any
statistically significant difference in callback rates is causally linked to
these attributes.
</p>
<p>Do you think it's reasonable to make a causal conclusion? You may have some
health skepticism. However, do take care to appreciate that this was an
experiment: the first name (and so the inferred race and gender) were
randomly assigned to the resumes, and the quality and attributes of a resume
were assigned independent of the race and gender. This means that any
effects we observe are in fact causal, and the effects related to race are
both statistically significant and very large: white applicants had about a
50\
</p>
<p>Do you still have doubts lingering in the back of your mind about the
validity of this study?  Maybe a counterargument about why the standard
conclusions from this study may not apply? The article summarizing the
results was exceptionally well-written, and it addresses many potential
concerns about the study's approach. So if you're feeling skeptical about
the conclusions, please find the link below and explore!

# Regarding the callback outcome for race,

tapply(

# Natural question: is this statisticaly significant?
# A proper analysis would take into account the
# paired nature of the data. For each ad, let's
# compute the following statistic:
#     &lt;callback rate for white candidates&gt;
#     - &lt;callback rate for black candidates&gt;
# First contruct the callbacks for white and
# black candidates by ad ID:
table(resume$race)
cb_white &lt;- with(
    subset(resume, race == "white"),
    tapply(received_callback, job_ad_id, mean))
cb_black &lt;- with(
    subset(resume, race == "black"),
    tapply(received_callback, job_ad_id, mean))
# Next, compute the differences, where the
# names(cb_white) part ensures we matched up the
# job ad IDs.
diff &lt;- cb_white - cb_black[names(cb_white)]
# Finally, we can apply a t-test on the differences:
t.test(diff)
# There is very strong evidence of an effect.

# Here's a similar check with gender. There are
# more female-inferred candidates used on the resumes.
table(resume$gender)
cb_male &lt;- with(
    subset(resume, gender == "m"),
    tapply(received_callback, job_ad_id, mean))
cb_female &lt;- with(
    subset(resume, gender == "f"),
    tapply(received_callback, job_ad_id, mean))
diff &lt;- cb_female - cb_male[names(cb_female)]
# The `na.rm = TRUE` part ensures we limit to jobs
# where both a male and female resume were sent.
t.test(diff, na.rm = TRUE)
# There is no statistically significant difference.

# Was that the best analysis? Absolutely not!
# However, the analysis was unbiased. To get more
# precision on the estimates, we could build a
# multivariate model that includes many characteristics
# of the resumes sent, e.g. years of experience.
# Since those other characteristics were assigned
# independently of the race characteristics, this
# means the race finding will almost certainy will
# hold. However, it is possible that we'll find
# more interesting results with the gender investigation.
