      :name: description

   A "social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what
   people do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked
   on by her boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same
   restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman
   was dressed "provocatively" and in the other scenario the woman was
   dressed "conservatively". The table below shows how many restaurant
   diners were present under each scenario, and whether or not they
   intervened.
