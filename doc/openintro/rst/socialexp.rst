         :name: description

      A "social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what
      people do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting
      picked on by her boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same
      restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In one scenario the
      woman was dressed "provocatively" and in the other scenario the
      woman was dressed "conservatively". The table below shows how many
      restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and whether or
      not they intervened.
