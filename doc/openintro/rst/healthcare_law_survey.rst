         :name: description

      For example, Pew Research Center conducted a survey with the
      following question: "As you may know, by 2014 nearly all Americans
      will be required to have health insurance. People who do not buy
      insurance will pay a penalty while people who cannot afford it
      will receive financial help from the government. Do you approve or
      disapprove of this policy?" For each randomly sampled respondent,
      the statements in brackets were randomized: either they were kept
      in the order given above, or the two statements were reversed.
