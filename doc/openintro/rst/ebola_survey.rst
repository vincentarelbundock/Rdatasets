      In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently
      been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a
      slight fever and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon
      thereafter, an NBC 4 New York/The Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll
      asked New Yorkers whether they favored a "mandatory 21-day
      quarantine for anyone who has come in contact with an Ebola
      patient". This poll included responses of 1,042 New York adults
      between October 26th and 28th, 2014.
