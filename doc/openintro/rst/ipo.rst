         :name: facebook-google-and-linkedin-ipo-filings

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      On Feb 1st, 2011, Facebook Inc. filed an S-1 form with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission as part of their initial public
      offering (IPO). This dataset includes the text of that document as
      well as text from the IPOs of two competing companies: Google and
      LinkedIn.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         ipo

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      The format is a list of three character vectors. Each vector
      contains the line-by-line text of the IPO Prospectus of Facebook,
      Google, and LinkedIn, respectively.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Each of the three prospectuses is encoded in UTF-8 format and
      contains some non-word characters related to the layout of the
      original documents. For analysis on the words, it is recommended
      that the data be processed with packages such as
      `tidytext <https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/>`__. See
      examples below.
