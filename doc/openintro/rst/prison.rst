   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an
   experiment involving an "isolation" experience. The goal of the
   experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects'
   psychopathic deviant T scores. This score measures a person's need
   for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of a
   commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic
   Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.
