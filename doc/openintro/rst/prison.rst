      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an
      experiment involving an "isolation" experience. The goal of the
      experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects'
      psychopathic deviant T scores. This score measures a person's need
      for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of
      a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota
      Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.
