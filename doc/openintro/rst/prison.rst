Prison isolation experiment
---------------------------

Description

Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an

deviant T scores. This score measures a person's need for control or
their rebellion against control, and it is part of a commonly used
mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory (MMPI) test.
