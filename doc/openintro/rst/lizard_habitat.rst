         habitat

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data on here lizard was observed and the level of sunlight. The
      data are collected on *Sceloporus occidentalis* (western fence
      lizards) by Stephen C. Adolph in 1983 (in desert and mountain
      sites) and by Dee Asbury in 2002-3 (in valley site).

      A data frame with 332 observations on the following 2 variables.

      site
         Site of lizard observation: ``desert``, ``mountain``, or
         ``valley``.

      sunlight
         Sunlight level at time of observation: ``sun`` (lizard was
         observed perching in full sunlight), ``partial`` (lizard was
         observed perching with part of its body in the sun, part in the
         shade), ``shade``\ (lizard was observed perching in the shade).
