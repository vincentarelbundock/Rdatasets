      .. rubric:: Pew Survey on Energy Sources in 2018
         :name: pew-survey-on-energy-sources-in-2018

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      US-based survey on support for expanding six different sources of
      energy, including solar, wind, offshore drilling, hydrolic
      fracturing ("fracking"), coal, and nuclear.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      The format is: List of 6 $ solar_panel_farms : List of responses
      on solar farms. $ wind_turbine_farms : List of responses on wind
      turbine farms. $ offshore_drilling : List of responses on offshore
      drilling. $ hydrolic_fracturing : List of responses on hydrolic
      fracturing. $ coal_mining : List of responses on coal mining. $
      nuclear_power_plants: List of responses on nuclear.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      We did not have access to individual responses in original data
      set, so we took the published percentages and backed out the
      breakdown
