      .. rubric:: Time Between Gondola Cars at Sterling Winery
         :name: time-between-gondola-cars-at-sterling-winery

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These times represent times between gondolas at Sterling Winery.
      The main take-away: there are 7 cars, as evidenced by the somewhat
      regular increases in splits between every 7 cars. The reason the
      times are slightly non-constant is that the gondolas come off the
      tracks, so times will change a little between each period.

      .. rubric:: Format

      A data frame with 52 observations on the following 2 variables.

      obs_number
         The observation number, e.g. observation 3 was immediately
         preceded by observation 2.

      time_until_next
         Time until this gondola car arrived since the last car had
         left.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Important context: there was a sufficient line that people were
      leaving the winery.

      So why is this data valuable? It indicates that the winery should
      add one more car since it has a lot of time wasted every 7th car.
      By adding another car, fewer visitors are likely to be turned
      away, resulting in increased revenue.
