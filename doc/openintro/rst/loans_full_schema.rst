      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data set represents thousands of loans made through the
      Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals
      to lend to other individuals. Of course, not all loans are created
      equal. Someone who is a essentially a sure bet to pay back a loan
      will have an easier time getting a loan with a low interest rate
      than someone who appears to be riskier. And for people who are
      very risky? They may not even get a loan offer, or they may not
      have accepted the loan offer due to a high interest rate. It is
      important to keep that last part in mind, since this data set only
      represents loans actually made, i.e. do not mistake this data for
      loan applications!
