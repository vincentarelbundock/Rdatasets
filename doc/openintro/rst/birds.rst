      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The FAA National Wildlife Strike Database contains strike reports
      that are voluntarily reported to the FAA by pilots, airlines,
      airports and others. Current research indicates that only about
      20\\ Wildlife strike reporting is not uniform as some
      organizations have more robust voluntary reporting procedures.
      Because of variations in reporting, users are cautioned that the
      comparisons between individual airports or airlines may be
      misleading.
