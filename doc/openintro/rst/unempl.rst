      Below is a direct quote from Wikipedia describing the sources of
      the data:

      Own work by Peace01234 Complete raw data are on Peace01234.
      1930-2009 data are from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),
      Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population,
      1940 to date retrieved on March 6, 2009 and February 12, 2010 from
      the BLS' FTP server. Data prior to 1948 are for persons age 14 and
      over. Data beginning in 1948 are for persons age 16 and over. See
      also "Historical Comparability" under the Household Data section
      of the Explanatory Notes at
      https://www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf. 1890-1930 data are
      from Christina Romer (1986). "Spurious Volatility in Historical
      Unemployment Data", The Journal of Political Economy, 94(1): 1-37.
      1930-1940 data are from Robert M. Coen (1973). "Labor Force and
      Unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's: A Re-Examination Based on
      Postwar Experience", The Review of Economics and Statistics,
      55(1): 46-55. Unemployment data was only surveyed once each decade
      until 1940 when yearly surveys were begun. The yearly data
      estimates before 1940 are based on the decade surveys combined
      with other relevant surveys that were collected during those
      years. The methods are described in detail by Coen and Romer.
