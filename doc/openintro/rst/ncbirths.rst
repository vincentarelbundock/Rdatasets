         :name: description

      In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a
      large data set containing information on births recorded in this
      state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers
      who are studying the relation between habits and practices of
      expectant mothers and the birth of their children. This is a
      random sample of 1,000 cases from this data set.
