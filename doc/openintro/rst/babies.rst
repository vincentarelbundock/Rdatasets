         :name: description

      The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of
      topics. One study, in particular, considered all pregnancies
      between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health
      Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. We do not have ideal
      provenance for these data. For a better documented and more recent
      dataset on a similar topic with similar variables, see births14.
      Additionally, ``Gestation`` dataset in the
      `mosaicData <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mosaicData>`__
      package also contains similar data.
