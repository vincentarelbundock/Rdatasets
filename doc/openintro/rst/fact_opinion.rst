      Pew Research Center conducted a survey in 2018, asking a sample of
      U.S. adults to categorize five factual and five opinion
      statements. This dataset provides data from this survey, with
      information on the age group of the participant as well as the
      number of factual and opinion statements they classified correctly
      (out of 5).
