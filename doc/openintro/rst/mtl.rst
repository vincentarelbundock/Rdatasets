         :name: description

      The data are from a convenience sample of 25 women and 10 men who
      were middle-aged or older. The purpose of the study was to
      understand the relationship between sedentary behavior and
      thickness of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the brain.

      A data frame with 35 observations on the following 23 variables.

      subject
         ID for the individual.

      sex
         Gender, which takes values ``F`` (female) or ``M`` (male).

      ethnic
         Ethnicity, simplified to ``Caucasian`` and ``Other``.

      educ
         Years of educational.

      e4grp
         APOE-4 status, taking a value of ``E4`` or ``Non-E4``.

      age
         Age, in years.

      mmse
         Score from the Mini-Mental State Examination, which is a global
         cognition evaluation.

      ham_a
         Score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for anxiety.

      ham_d
         Score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression.

      dig_sym
         We (the authors of this R package) are unsure as to the meaning
         of this variable.

      delay_vp
         We (the authors of this R package) are unsure as to the meaning
         of this variable.

      bfr_selective_reminding_delayed
         We (the authors of this R package) are unsure as to the meaning
         of this variable.

      sitting
         Self-reported time sitting per day, averaged to the nearest
         hour.

      met_minwk
         Metabolic equivalent units score (activity level). A score of
         ``0`` means "no activity" while ``3000`` is considered "high
         activity".

      ipa_qgrp
         Classification of ``METminwk`` into ``Low`` or ``High``.

      aca1
         Thickness of the CA1 subregion of the MTL.

      aca23dg
         Thickness of the CA23DG subregion of the MTL.

      ae_cort
         Thickness of a subregion of the MTL.

      a_fusi_cort
         Thickness of the fusiform gyrus subregion of the MTL.

      a_ph_cort
         Thickness of the perirhinal cortex subregion of the MTL.

      a_pe_cort
         Thickness of the entorhinal cortex subregion of the MTL.

      asubic
         Thickness of the subiculum subregion of the MTL.

      total
         Total MTL thickness.
