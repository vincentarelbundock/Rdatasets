   .. rubric:: Embryonic stem cells to treat heart attack (in sheep)
      :name: stem_cell

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart
   function following a heart attack? Each sheep in the study was
   randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in
   their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study. A positive
   value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally
   suggests a stronger recovery.
