         :name: embryonic-stem-cells-to-treat-heart-attack-in-sheep

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve
      heart function following a heart attack? Each sheep in the study
      was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change
      in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study. A
      positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which
      generally suggests a stronger recovery.
