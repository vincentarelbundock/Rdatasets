Embryonic stem cells to treat heart attack (in sheep)
-----------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart
function following a heart attack? Each sheep in the study was randomly
assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts'
pumping capacity was measured in the study. A positive value corresponds
to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger
recovery.
