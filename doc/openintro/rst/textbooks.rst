      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The sample represents only courses where textbooks were listed
      online through UCLA Bookstore's website. The most expensive
      textbook was selected based on the UCLA Bookstore price, which may
      insert bias into the data; for this reason, it may be beneficial
      to analyze only the data where ``more`` is ``"N"``.
