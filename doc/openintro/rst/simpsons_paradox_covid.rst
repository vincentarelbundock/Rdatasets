      .. rubric:: Simpson's Paradox: Covid
         :name: simpsons-paradox-covid

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A dataset on Delta Variant Covid-19 cases in the UK. This dataset
      gives a great example of Simpson's Paradox. When aggregating
      results without regard to age group, the death rate for vaccinated
      individuals is higher – but they have a much higher risk
      population. Once we look at populations with more comparable risks
      (breakout age groups), we see that the vaccinated group tends to
      be lower risk in each risk-bucketed group and that many of the
      higher risk patients had gotten vaccinated. The dataset was
      brought to OpenIntro's attention by Matthew T. Brenneman of
      Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Note: some totals in the
      original source differ as there were some cases that did not have
      ages associated with them.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 286,166 rows and 3 variables:

      age_group
         Age of the person. Levels: ``⁠under 50⁠``, ``⁠50 +⁠``.

      vaccine_status
         Vaccination status of the person. Note: the vaccinated group
         includes those who were only partially vaccinated. Levels:
         ``vaccinated``, ``unvaccinated``

      outcome
         Did the person die from the Delta variant? Levels: ``death``
         and ``survived``.
