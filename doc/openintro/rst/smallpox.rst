      A sample of 6,224 individuals from the year 1721 who were exposed
      to smallpox in Boston. Some of them had received a vaccine
      (inoculated) while others had not. Doctors at the time believed
      that inoculation, which involves exposing a person to the disease
      in a controlled form, could reduce the likelihood of death.
