      On March 31, 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that "in a Phase
      3 trial in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with or without prior
      evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
      vaccine BNT162b2 demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust antibody
      responses, exceeding those recorded earlier in vaccinated
      participants aged 16 to 25 years old, and was well tolerated."
      These results are from a Phase 3 trial in 2,260 adolescents 12 to
      15 years of age in the United States. In the trial, 18 cases of
      COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group (n = 1,129) versus
      none in the vaccinated group (n = 1,131).
