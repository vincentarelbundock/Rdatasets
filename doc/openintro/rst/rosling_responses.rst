         :name: sample-responses-to-two-public-health-questions

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Public health has improved and evolved, but has the public's
      knowledge changed with it? This data set explores sample responses
      for two survey questions posed by Hans Rosling during lectures to
      a wide array of well-educated audiences.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 278 rows and 3 variables:

      question
         ID for the question being posed.

      response
         Noting whether the response was ``correct`` or ``incorrect``.

      prob_random_correct
         The probability the person would have guessed the answer
         correctly if they were guessing completely randomly.

      The samples we describe are plausible based on the exact rates
      observed in larger samples. For more info on the actual rates
      observed, visit https://www.gapminder.org.

      Another relevant reference is a book by Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling
      Ronnlund, and Ola Rosling called
      `Factfulness <https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/>`__.
