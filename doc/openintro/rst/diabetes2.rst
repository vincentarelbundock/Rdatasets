      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Three treatments were compared to test their relative efficacy
      (effectiveness) in treating Type 2 Diabetes in patients aged 10-17
      who were being treated with metformin. The primary outcome was
      lack of glycemic control (or not); lacking glycemic control means
      the patient still needed insulin, which is not the preferred
      outcome for a patient.
