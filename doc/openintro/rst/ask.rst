         :name: description

      In this experiment, each individual was asked to be a seller of an
      iPod (a product commonly used to store music on before smart
      phones...). They participant received $10 + 5% of the sale price
      for participating. The iPod they were selling had frozen twice in
      the past inexplicably but otherwise worked fine. The prospective
      buyer starts off and then asks one of three final questions,
      depending on the seller's treatment group.

      A data frame with 219 observations on the following 3 variables.

      question_class
         The type of question: ``general``, ``pos_assumption``, and
         ``neg_assumption``.

      question
         The question corresponding to the ``question.class``

      response
         The classified response from the seller, either ``disclose`` or
         ``hide``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The three possible questions:

      -  General: What can you tell me about it?

      -  Positive Assumption: It doesn't have any problems, does it?

      -  Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?

      The outcome variable is whether or not the participant discloses
      or hides the problem with the iPod.

      stupid question: Question disclosure in strategic communication.
