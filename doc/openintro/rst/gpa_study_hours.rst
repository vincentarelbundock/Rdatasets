      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 193 observations on the following 2 variables.

      gpa
         Grade point average (GPA) of student.

      study_hours
         Number of hours students study per week.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      GPA ranges from 0 to 4 points, however one student reported a GPA
      > 4. This is a data error but this observation has been left in
      the dataset as it is used to illustrate issues with real survey
      data. Both variables are self reported, hence may not be accurate.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source
