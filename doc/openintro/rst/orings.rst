      .. rubric:: 1986 Challenger disaster and O-rings
         :name: challenger-disaster-and-o-rings

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      On January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the
      Challenger space shuttle. Seventy-three seconds into the flight,
      disaster happened: the shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew
      members on board. An investigation into the cause of the disaster
      focused on a critical seal called an O-ring, and it is believed
      that damage to these O-rings during a shuttle launch may be
      related to the ambient temperature during the launch. The table
      below summarizes observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle
      missions, where the mission order is based on the temperature at
      the time of the launch.
