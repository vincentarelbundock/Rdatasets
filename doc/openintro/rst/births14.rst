         :name: description

      Every year, the US releases to the public a large data set
      containing information on births recorded in the country. This
      data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are
      studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant
      mothers and the birth of their children. This is a random sample
      of 1,000 cases from the data set released in 2014.
