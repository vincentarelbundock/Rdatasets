         :name: description

      Resumes were sent out to 316 top law firms in the United States,
      and there were two randomized characteristics of each resume.
      First, the gender associated with the resume was randomized by
      assigning a first name of either James or Julia. Second, the
      socioeconomic class of the candidate was randomly assigned and
      represented through five minor changes associated with personal
      interests and other other minor details (e.g. an extracurricular
      activity of sailing team vs track and field). The outcome variable
      was whether the candidate was received an interview.

      A data frame with 316 observations on the following 3 variables.
      Each row represents a resume sent a top law firm for this
      experiment.

      class
         The resume represented irrelevant details suggesting either
         ``"low"`` or ``"high"`` socioeconomic class.

      gender
         The resume implied the candidate was either ``"male"`` or
         ``"female"``.

      outcome
         If the candidate received an invitation for an ``"interview"``
         or ``"not"``.
