      .. rubric:: Energy Output From Two Solar Arrays in San Francisco
         :name: energy-output-from-two-solar-arrays-in-san-francisco

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data provide the energy output for several months from two
      roof-top solar arrays in San Francisco. This city is known for
      having highly variable weather, so while these two arrays are only
      about 1 mile apart from each other, the Inner Sunset location
      tends to have more fog.

      A data frame with 284 observations on the following 3 variables.
      Each row represents a single day for one of the arrays.

      location
         Location for the array.

      date
         Date.

      kwh
         Number of kWh

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The Haight-Ashbury array is a 10.4 kWh array, while the Inner
      Sunset array is a 2.8 kWh array. The kWh units represents
      kilowatt-hours, which is the unit of energy that typically is used
      for electricity bills. The cost per kWh in San Francisco was about
      $0.25 in 2016.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      These data were provided by Larry Rosenfeld, a resident in San
      Francisco.
