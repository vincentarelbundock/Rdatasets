      A data frame with 705 observations on the following variable.

      statement
         There were three possible outcomes for each person:
         ``"Regulations necessary"``,
         ``"Private marketplace will ensure"``, and ``"Don't know"``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The exact statements being selected were: (1) Government
      regulations are necessary to encourage businesses and consumers to
      rely more on renewable energy sources. (2) The private marketplace
      will ensure that businesses and consumers rely more on renewable
      energy sources, even without government regulations.

      The actual sample size was 1012. However, the original data were
      not from a simple random sample; after accounting for the design,
      the equivalent sample size was about 705, which was what was used
      for the data set here to keep things simpler for intro stat
      analyses.
