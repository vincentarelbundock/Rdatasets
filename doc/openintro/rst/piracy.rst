      The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual
      Property Act (PIPA) were two bills introduced in the US House of
      Representatives and the US Senate, respectively, to curtail
      copyright infringement. The bill was controversial because there
      were concerns the bill limited free speech rights. ProPublica, the
      independent and non-profit news organization, compiled this data
      set to compare the stance of legislators towards the bills with
      the amount of campaign funds that they received from groups
      considered to be supportive of or in opposition to the
      legislation.

      For more background on the legislation and the formulation of
      ``money_pro`` and ``money_con``, read the documentation on
      ProPublica, linked below.

      of date since many politician's perspectives on the legislation
      were in flux at the time of data collection.
