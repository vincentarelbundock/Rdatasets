      A data frame with 143 observations on the following 12 variables.
      All prices are in US dollars.

      id
         Auction ID assigned by Ebay.

      duration
         Auction length, in days.

      n_bids
         Number of bids.

      cond
         Game condition, either ``new`` or ``used``.

      start_pr
         Start price of the auction.

      ship_pr
         Shipping price.

      total_pr
         Total price, which equals the auction price plus the shipping
         price.

      ship_sp
         Shipping speed or method.

      seller_rate
         The seller's rating on Ebay. This is the number of positive
         ratings minus the number of negative ratings for the seller.

      stock_photo
         Whether the auction feature photo was a stock photo or not. If
         the picture was used in many auctions, then it was called a
         stock photo.

      wheels
         Number of Wii wheels included in the auction. These are
         steering wheel attachments to make it seem as though you are
         actually driving in the game. When used with the controller,
         turning the wheel actually causes the character on screen to
         turn.

      title
         The title of the auctions.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      There are several interesting features in the data. First off,
      note that there are two outliers in the data. These serve as a
      nice example of what one should do when encountering an outlier:
      examine the data point and remove it only if there is a good
      reason. In these two cases, we can see from the auction titles
      that they included other items in their auctions besides the game,
      which justifies removing them from the data set.

      This data set includes all auctions for a full week in October
      2009. Auctions were included in the data set if they satisfied a
      number of conditions. (1) They were included in a search for "wii
      mario kart" on ebay.com, (2) items were in the Video Games > Games
      > Nintendo Wii section of Ebay, (3) the listing was an auction and
      not exclusively a "Buy it Now" listing (sellers sometimes offer an
      optional higher price for a buyer to end bidding and win the
      auction immediately, which is an *optional* Buy it Now auction),
      (4) the item listed was the actual game, (5) the item was being
      sold from the US, (6) the item had at least one bidder, (7) there
      were no other items included in the auction with the exception of
      racing wheels, either generic or brand-name being acceptable, and
      (8) the auction did not end with a Buy It Now option.
