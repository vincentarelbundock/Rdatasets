      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      A past data set was collected from UCLA courses in Spring 2010,
      and Amazon at that time was found to be almost uniformly lower
      than those of the UCLA bookstore's. Now in 2018, the UCLA
      bookstore is about even with Amazon on the vast majority of
      titles, and there is no statistical difference in the sample data.

      The most expensive book required for the course was generally
      used.

      The reason why we advocate for using raw amount differences
      instead of percent differences is that a 20\\ to a 20\\ price
      difference on low-priced books would balance numerically (but not
      in a practical sense) a moderate but important price difference on
      more expensive books. So while this tends to result in a bit less
      sensitivity in detecting *some* effect, we believe the absolute
      difference compares prices in a more meaningful way.

      Used prices contain the shipping cost but do not contain tax. The
      used prices are a more nuanced comparison, since these are all 3rd
      party sellers. Amazon is often more a marketplace than a retail
      site at this point, and many people buy from 3rd party sellers on
      Amazon now without realizing it. The relationship Amazon has with
      3rd party sellers is also challenging. Given the frequently
      changing dynamics in this space, we don't think any analysis here
      will be very reliable for long term insights since products from
      these sellers changes frequently in quantity and price. For this
      reason, we focus only on new books sold directly by Amazon in our
      comparison. In a future round of data collection, it may be
      interesting to explore whether the dynamics have changed in the
      used market.
