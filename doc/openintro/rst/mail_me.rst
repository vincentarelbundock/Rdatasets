      .. rubric:: Influence of a Good Mood on Helpfulness
         :name: influence-of-a-good-mood-on-helpfulness

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This study investigated whether finding a coin influenced a
      person's likelihood of mailing a sealed but addressed letter that
      appeared to have been accidentally left in a conspicuous place.
      Several variables were collected during the experiment, including
      two randomized variables of whether there was a coin to be found
      and whether the letter already had a stamp on it.

      The precise context was in a phone booth (this study is from the
      1970s!), where a person who entered a phone booth would find a
      dime in the phone tray, which would be sufficient to pay for their
      phone call. There was also a letter next to the phone, which
      sometimes had a stamp on it.
