      This data set addresses issues of how superstitions regarding
      Friday the 13th affect human behavior, and whether Friday the 13th
      is an unlucky day. Scanlon, et al. collected data on traffic and
      shopping patterns and accident frequency for Fridays the 6th and
      13th between October of 1989 and November of 1992.

      There are three types of observations: traffic, shopping, and
      accident. For traffic, the researchers obtained information from
      the British Department of Transport regarding the traffic flows
      between junctions 7 to 8 and junctions 9 to 10 of the M25
      motorway. For shopping, they collected the numbers of shoppers in
      nine different supermarkets in southeast England. For accidents,
      they collected numbers of emergency admissions to hospitals due to
      transport accidents.
