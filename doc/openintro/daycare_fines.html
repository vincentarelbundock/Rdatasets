<h2>Daycare fines</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Researchers tested the deterrence hypothesis which predicts that the
introduction of a penalty will reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject
to the fine, with the condition that the fine leaves everything else
unchanged by instituting a fine for late pickup at daycare centers.
For this study, they worked with 10 volunteer daycare centers that did not
originally impose a fine to parents for picking up their kids late.
They randomly selected 6 of these daycare centers and instituted a monetary
fine (of a considerable amount) for picking up children late and then removed it.
In the remaining 4 daycare centers no fine was introduced.
The study period was divided into four: before the fine (weeks 1–4), the first
4 weeks with the fine (weeks 5-8), the entire period with the fine (weeks 5–16),
and the after fine period (weeks 17-20). Throughout the study, the number of kids
who were picked up late was recorded each week for each daycare. The study
found that the number of late-coming parents increased significantly when the
fine was introduced, and no reduction occurred after the fine was removed.
