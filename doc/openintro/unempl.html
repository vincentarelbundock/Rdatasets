data:
</p>
<p>Own work by Peace01234 Complete raw data are on Peace01234. 1930-2009 data
are from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Employment status of the civilian
noninstitutional population, 1940 to date retrieved on March 6, 2009
and February 12, 2010 from the BLS' FTP server. Data prior to 1948 are for persons age
14 and over. Data beginning in 1948 are for persons age 16 and over. See
also &quot;Historical Comparability&quot; under the Household Data section of the
Explanatory Notes at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf</a>.
1890-1930 data are from Christina Romer (1986). &quot;Spurious Volatility in
Historical Unemployment Data&quot;, The Journal of Political Economy, 94(1):
1-37. 1930-1940 data are from Robert M. Coen (1973). &quot;Labor Force and
Unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's: A Re-Examination Based on Postwar
Experience&quot;, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 55(1): 46-55.
Unemployment data was only surveyed once each decade until 1940 when yearly
surveys were begun. The yearly data estimates before 1940 are based on the
decade surveys combined with other relevant surveys that were collected
during those years. The methods are described in detail by Coen and Romer.
