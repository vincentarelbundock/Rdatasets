<h2>Heart Transplant Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine
whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each
patient entering the program was designated officially a heart transplant
candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit
from a new heart. Then the actual heart transplant occurs between a few
weeks to several months depending on the availability of a donor. Very few
candidates during this waiting period show improvement and get
<em>deselected</em> as a heart transplant candidate, but for the purposes of
this experiment those patients were kept in the data as continuing
candidates.
