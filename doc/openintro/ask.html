<h2>How important is it to ask pointed questions?</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In this experiment, each individual was asked to be a seller of an iPod (a
product commonly used to store music on before smart phones...).  They
participant received $10 + 5% of the sale price for participating.  The
iPod they were selling had frozen twice in the past inexplicably but
otherwise worked fine. The prospective buyer starts off and then asks one of
three final questions, depending on the seller's treatment group.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>ask
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 219 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>question_class</dt><dd><p>The type of question:
<code>general</code>, <code>pos_assumption</code>, and <code>neg_assumption</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>question</dt><dd><p>The question corresponding to the
<code>question.class</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>response</dt><dd><p>The classified response from the seller,
either <code>disclose</code> or <code>hide</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The three possible questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> General: What can you tell me about it?
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Positive Assumption: It doesn't have any problems, does it?
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The outcome variable is whether or not the participant discloses or hides
the problem with the iPod.
</p>

a stupid question: Question disclosure in strategic communication.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Distribution of responses based on question type
ask %&gt;%
  count(question_class, response)

# Visualize relative frequencies of responses based on question type
ggplot(ask, aes(x = question_class, fill = response)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

# Perform chi-square test
(test &lt;- chisq.test(table(ask$question_class, ask$response)))

# Check the test's assumption around sufficient expected observations
# per table cell.
