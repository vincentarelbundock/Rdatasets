<h2>Survey on Ebola quarantine</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently been
treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a slight fever
and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon thereafter, an NBC 4 New
York/The Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll asked New Yorkers whether they
favored a &quot;mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come in contact
with an Ebola patient&quot;. This poll included responses of 1,042 New York
adults between October 26th and 28th, 2014.
