<h2>Lecture Delivery Method and Learning Outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data was collected from 276 students in a university psychology course
to determine the effect of lecture delivery method on learning. Students were
presented a live lecture by the professor on one day and a pre-recorded
lecture on a different topic by the same professor on a different day.
Survey data was collected during the lectures to determine mind wandering,
interest, and motivation.  Students were also ultimately asked about the
preferred lecture delivery method. Finally, students completed an assessment
at the end of the lecture to determine memory recall.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>lecture_learning
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 552 rows and 8 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>student</dt><dd><p>Identification number of a specific student.
Each identification appears twice because same student heard both lecture
delivery methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gender</dt><dd><p>Gender of student. Recored a binary variable with levels
Male and Female in the study.</p>
</dd>
<dt>method</dt><dd><p>Delivery method of lecture was either in-person(Live) or
pre-recorded(Video).</p>
</dd>
<dt>mindwander</dt><dd><p>An indicator of distraction during the lecture. It is a
proportion of six mind wandering probes during the lecture when a student
answered yes that mind wandering had just occurred.</p>
</dd>
<dt>memory</dt><dd><p>An indicator of recall of information provided during the
lecture. It is the proportion of correct answers in a six question assessment
given at the end of the lecture presentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>interest</dt><dd><p>A Likert scale that gauged student interest level concerning
the lecture.</p>
</dd>
<dt>motivation_both</dt><dd><p>After experiencing both lecture delivery methods,
students were asked about which method they were most motivated to remain
attentive.</p>
</dd>
<dt>motivation_single</dt><dd><p>After a single lecture delivery experience, this
Likert scale was used to gauge motivation to remain attentive during the
lecture.</p>
</dd>
