<h2>Opportunity cost of purchases</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a study on opportunity cost, 150 students were given the following statement:
&quot;Imagine that you have been saving some extra money on the side to make some
purchases, and on your most recent visit to the video store you come across
a special sale on a new video. This video is one with your favorite actor or
actress, and your favorite type of movie (such as a comedy, drama, thriller,
etc.). This particular video that you are considering is one you have been
thinking about buying for a long time. It is available for a special sale
price of $14.99. What would you do in this situation? Please circle one of
the options below.&quot; Half of the students were given the following two options:
(A) Buy this entertaining video. (B) Not buy this entertaining video. The
other half were given the following two options (note the modified option B):
(A) Buy this entertaining video. (B) Not buy this entertaining video.
Keep the $14.99 for other purchases.
The results of this study are in this dataset.
