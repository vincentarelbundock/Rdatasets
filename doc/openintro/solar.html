<h2>Energy Output From Two Solar Arrays in San Francisco</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data provide the energy output for several months from two roof-top
solar arrays in San Francisco. This city is known for having highly variable
weather, so while these two arrays are only about 1 mile apart from each
other, the Inner Sunset location tends to have more fog.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
solar
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 284 observations on the following 3 variables.
Each row represents a single day for one of the arrays.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>location</dt><dd><p>Location for the array.</p>
</dd>
<dt>date</dt><dd><p>Date.</p>
</dd>
<dt>kwh</dt><dd><p>Number of kWh</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Haight-Ashbury array is a 10.4 kWh array, while the Inner Sunset array
is a 2.8 kWh array. The kWh units represents kilowatt-hours, which is
the unit of energy that typically is used for electricity bills. The cost
per kWh in San Francisco was about $0.25 in 2016.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>These data were provided by Larry Rosenfeld, a resident in San Francisco.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

solar.is &lt;- subset(solar, location == "Inner_Sunset")
solar.ha &lt;- subset(solar, location == "Haight_Ashbury")
plot(solar.is$date, solar.is$kwh, type = "l", ylim = c(0, max(solar$kwh)))
lines(solar.ha$date, solar.ha$kwh, col = 4)

d &lt;- merge(solar.ha, solar.is, by = "date")
plot(d$date, d$kwh.x / d$kwh.y, type = "l")

</pre>
