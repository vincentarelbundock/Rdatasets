<h2>Loan data from Lending Club</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set represents thousands of loans made through the Lending Club
platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other
individuals. Of course, not all loans are created equal. Someone who is a
essentially a sure bet to pay back a loan will have an easier time getting a
loan with a low interest rate than someone who appears to be riskier. And
for people who are very risky? They may not even get a loan offer, or they
may not have accepted the loan offer due to a high interest rate. It is
important to keep that last part in mind, since this data set only
represents loans actually made, i.e. do not mistake this data for loan
applications!
