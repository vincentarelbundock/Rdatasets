<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act
(PIPA) were two bills introduced in the US House of Representatives and the
US Senate, respectively, to curtail copyright infringement.  The bill was
controversial because there were concerns the bill limited free speech
rights.  ProPublica, the independent and non-profit news organization,
compiled this data set to compare the stance of legislators towards the
bills with the amount of campaign funds that they received from groups
considered to be supportive of or in opposition to the legislation.
</p>
<p>For more background on the legislation and the formulation of
<code>money_pro</code> and <code>money_con</code>, read the documentation on ProPublica,
linked below.

The list may be slightly out of date since many politician's perspectives on
the legislation were in flux at the time of data collection.
