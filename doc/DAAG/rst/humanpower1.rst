         data(humanpower1)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 28 observations on the following 3 variables.

      wattsPerKg
         a numeric vector: watts per kilogram of body weight

      o2
         a numeric vector: ml/min/kg

      id
         a factor with levels 1 - 5 (``humanpower1``) or 1 - 4
         (``humanpower2``), identifying the different athletes

         :name: details

      Data in ``humanpower1`` are from investigations (Bussolari 1987)
      designed to assess the feasibility of a proposed 119 kilometer
      human powered flight from the island of Crete – in the initial
      phase of the Daedalus project. Data are for five athletes – a
      female hockey player, a male amateur tri-athlete, a female amateur
      triathlete, a male wrestler and a male cyclist – who were selected
      from volunteers who were recruited through the news media, Data in
      ``humanpower2) are for four out of the 25 applicants who were selected for further testing, in the lead-up to the eventual selection of a pilot for the Daedalus project (Nadel and Bussolari 1988).``
