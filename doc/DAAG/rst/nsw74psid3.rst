         :name: description

      This ``nsw74demo`` data frame, with 445 rows and 10 columns, is
      the subset of the ``nswdemo`` dataset for which 1974 earnings are
      available. Data are for the male experimental control and
      treatment groups, in an investigation of the effect of training on
      changes, between 1974-1975 and 1978, in the earnings of
      individuals who had experienced employment difficulties.

      Likewise, ``nsw74psid1`` (2675 rows) is the subset of the
      ``nswpsid1`` data, and ``nsw74psid3`` (313 rows) is the subset of
      the ``nswpsid3`` data, for which 1974 income is available. NB,
      also, the ``nsw74psidA`` data set.

      ``nsw74psid1`` using:

      ``here <- age <= 40 & re74<=5000 & re75 <= 5000 & re78 < 30000``

      ``nsw74psidA <- nsw74psid1[here, ]``
