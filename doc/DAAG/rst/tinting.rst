      .. rubric:: Car Window Tinting Experiment Data
         :name: car-window-tinting-experiment-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These data are from an experiment that aimed to model the effects
      of the tinting of car windows on visual performance. The authors
      were mainly interested in effects on side window vision, and hence
      in visual recognition tasks that would be performed when looking
      through side windows.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      case
         observation number

      id
         subject identifier code (1-26)

      age
         age (in years)

      sex
         a factor with levels ``f`` female, ``m`` male

      tint
         an ordered factor with levels representing degree of tinting:
         ``no`` < ``lo`` < ``hi``

      target
         a factor with levels ``locon``: low contrast, ``hicon``: high
         contrast

      it
         the inspection time, the time required to perform a simple
         discrimination task (in milliseconds)

      csoa
         critical stimulus onset asynchrony, the time to recognize an
         alphanumeric target (in milliseconds)

      agegp
         a factor with levels ``younger``, 21-27, ``older``, 70-78

      Visual light transmittance (VLT) levels were 100% (tint=none),
      81.3% (tint=lo), and 35.1% (tint=hi). Based on these and other
      data, Burns et al. argue that road safety may be compromised if
      the front side windows of cars are tinted to 35
