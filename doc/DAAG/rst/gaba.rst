      .. rubric:: Effect of pentazocine on post-operative pain (average
         VAS scores)
         :name: effect-of-pentazocine-on-post-operative-pain-average-vas-scores

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The table shows, separately for males and females, the effect of
      pentazocine on post-operative pain profiles (average VAS scores),
      with (mbac and fbac) and without (mpl and fpl) preoperatively
      administered baclofen. Pain scores are recorded every 20 minutes,
      from 10 minutes to 170 minutes.

      A data frame with 9 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``min``
         a numeric vector

      ``mbac``
         a numeric vector

      ``mpl``
         a numeric vector

      ``fbac``
         a numeric vector

      ``fpl``
         a numeric vector

      ``avbac``
         a numeric vector

      ``avplac``
         a numeric vector

         :name: details

      15 females were given baclofen, as against 3 males. 7 females
      received the placebo, as against 16 males. Averages for the two
      treatments (baclofen/placebo), taken over all trial participants
      and ignoring sex, are misleading.
