         by Region

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Australian regional temperature data, Australian regional rainfall
      data, and Annual SOI, are given for the years 1900-2021. The
      regional rainfall and temperature data are area-weighted averages
      for the respective regions. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)
      is the difference in barometric pressure at sea level between
      Tahiti and Darwin.

      Go to website, choose timeseries to display, then click "Download
      data"

      The SOI data are from
      http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/soi_monthly.txt.

      The CO2 series ``co2law``, for Law Dome ice core data. is from
      https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/lawdome-data.html.

      The Moana Loa CO2 series ``co2mlo`` is from Dr. Pieter Tans,
      NOAA/ESRL (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/)

      The series ``CO2`` is a composite series, obtained by adding 0.46
      to the Law data for 1900 to 1958, then following this with the
      Moana Loa data that is avaiable from 1959. The addition of 0.46
      brings the average of the Law data into agreement with that for
      the Moana Loa data for the period 1959 to 1968.

      The yearly mean sunspot number is a subset of one of several
      sunspot series that are available from WDC-SILSO, Royal
      Observatory of Belgium, Brussels.

      The dipole mode index data are from
      https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/elnino/index/Readme_iod.txt.
      Note also https://stateoftheocean.osmc.noaa.gov/sur/ind/dmi.php,
      which has details of several other such series.
