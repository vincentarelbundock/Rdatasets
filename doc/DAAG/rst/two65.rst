         :name: unpaired-heated-elastic-bands

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Twenty-one elastic bands were divided into two groups.

      One of the sets was placed in hot water (60-65 degrees C) for four
      minutes, while the other was left at ambient temperature. After a
      wait of about ten minutes, the amounts of stretch, under a 1.35 kg
      weight, were recorded.
