         :name: description

      Year and birth, lifespan, etc, of British first class cricketers,
      born 1840-1960, whose handedness could be determined from
      information in the Who's who of cricketers. The status (alive=0,
      dead =1), and lifetime or lifespan, is for 1992.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 5960 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``left``
         a factor with levels ``right`` ``left``

      ``year``
         numeric, year of birth

      ``life``
         numeric, lifetime or lifespan to 1992

      ``dead``
         numeric (0 = alive (censored), 1 = dead, in 1992)

      ``acd``
         numeric (0 = not accidental or not dead, 1 = accidental death)

      ``kia``
         numeric (0 = not killed in action, 1 = killed in action)

      ``inbed``
         numeric (0 = did not die in bed, 1 = died in bed)

      ``cause``
         a factor with levels ``alive`` ``acd`` (accidental death)
         ``inbed`` (died in bed)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Note that those 'killed in action' (mostly during World Wars I and
      II) form a subset of those who died by accident.
