      This data frame contains the following columns:

      State
         a factor with levels ``ACT`` Australian Capital Territory,
         ``NSW`` New South Wales

      PrivPub
         a factor with levels ``private`` school, ``public`` school

      school
         a factor, coded to identify the school

      class
         a factor, coded to identify the class

      sex
         a factor with levels ``f``, ``m``

      like
         a summary score based on two of the questions, on a scale from
         1 (dislike) to 12 (like)
