      Data record, for each of 2000 administrative regions, whether or
      not dengue was recorded at any time between 1961 and 1990.

      A data frame with 2000 observations on the following 13 variables.

      humid
         Average vapour density: 1961-1990

      humid90
         90th percentile of ``humid``

      temp
         Average temperature: 1961-1990

      temp90
         90th percentile of ``temp``

      h10pix
         maximum of ``humid``, within a 10 pixel radius

      h10pix90
         maximum of ``humid90``, within a 10 pixel radius

      trees
         Percent tree cover, from satellite data

      trees90
         90th percentile of ``trees``

      NoYes
         Was dengue observed? (1=yes)

      Xmin
         minimum longitude

      Xmax
         maximum longitude

      Ymin
         minimum latitude

      Ymax
         maximum latitude

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This is derived from a data set in which the climate and tree
      cover information were given for each half degree of latitude by
      half degreee of longitude pixel. The variable ``NoYes`` was given
      by administrative region. The climate data and tree cover data
      given here are 50th or 90th percentiles, where percetiles were
      calculates across pixels for an administrative region.
