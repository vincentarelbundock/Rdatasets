      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data are total available pure alcohol content, for the three
      categories, divided by numbers of persons aged 15 years or more.
      The source data for New Zealand included quarterly figures from
      December 1997, and annual data to December for all years. The
      annual New Zealand figure to June 1998 required an estimate for
      September 1997 that was obtained by extrapolating back the third
      quarter trend line from later years.
