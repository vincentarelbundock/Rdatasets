         :name: description

      The ``Manitoba.lakes`` data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns. The
      areas and elevations of the nine largest lakes in Manitoba,
      Canada. The geography of Manitoba (a relatively flat province) can
      be divided crudely into three main areas: a very flat prairie in
      the south which is at a relatively high elevation, a middle region
      consisting of mainly of forest and Precambrian rock, and a
      northern region which drains more rapidly into Hudson Bay. All
      water in Manitoba, which does not evaporate, eventually drains
      into Hudson Bay.
