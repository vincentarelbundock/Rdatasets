      A data frame with 10 observations on the following 12 variables.

      clength
         mean length of cuckoo eggs in given host's nest

      cl.sd
         standard deviation of cuckoo egg lengths

      cbreadth
         mean breadth of cuckoo eggs in given host's nest

      cb.sd
         standard deviation of cuckoo egg breadths

      cnum
         number of cuckoo eggs

      hlength
         length of host eggs

      hl.sd
         standard deviation of host egg lengths

      hbreadth
         breadth of host eggs

      hb.sd
         standard deviation of host egg breadths

      hnum
         number of host eggs

      match
         number of eggs where color matched

      nomatch
         number where color did not match

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Although from the same study that generated data in the data frame
      ``cuckoos``, the data do not match precisely. The cuckoo egg
      lengths and breadths are from the tables on page 168, the host egg
      lengths and breadths from Appendix IV on page 176, and the color
      match counts from the table on page 171.
