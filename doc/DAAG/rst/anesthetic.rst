      .. rubric:: Anesthetic Effectiveness
         :name: anesthetic-effectiveness

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Thirty patients were given an anesthetic agent maintained at a
      predetermined level (conc) for 15 minutes before making an
      incision. It was then noted whether the patient moved, i.e. jerked
      or twisted.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         anesthetic

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      move
         a binary numeric vector coded for patient movement (0 = no
         movement, 1 = movement)

      conc
         anesthetic concentration

      logconc
         logarithm of concentration

      nomove
         the complement of move

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The interest is in estimating how the probability of jerking or
      twisting varies with increasing concentration of the anesthetic
      agent.
