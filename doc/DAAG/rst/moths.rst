      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``moths`` data frame has 41 rows and 4 columns. These data are
      from a study of the effect of habitat on the densities of two
      species of moth (A and P). Transects were set across the search
      area. Within transects, sections were identified according to
      habitat type.

      P
         number of type P moths found

      habitat
