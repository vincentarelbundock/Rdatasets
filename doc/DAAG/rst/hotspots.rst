         :name: hawaian-island-chain-hotspot-potassium-argon-ages

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      K-Ar Ages (millions of years) and distances (km) from Kilauea
      along the trend of the chain of Hawaian volcanic islands and other
      seamounts that are believed to have been created by a moving "hot
      spot". The age of Kilauea is given as 0-0.4 Ma.
