      The ``frogs`` data frame has 212 rows and 11 columns. The data are
      on the distribution of the Southern Corroboree frog, which occurs
      in the Snowy Mountains area of New South Wales, Australia.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      pres.abs
         0 = frogs were absent, 1 = frogs were present

      northing
         reference point

      easting
         reference point

      altitude
         altitude , in meters

      distance
         distance in meters to nearest extant population

      NoOfPools
         number of potential breeding pools

      NoOfSites
         (number of potential breeding sites within a 2 km radius

      avrain
         mean rainfall for Spring period

      meanmin
         mean minimum Spring temperature

      meanmax
         mean maximum Spring temperature
