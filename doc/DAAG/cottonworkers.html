<h2>Occupation and wage profiles of British cotton workers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Numbers are given in different categories of worker, in each of
two investigations.  The first source of information is the
Board of Trade Census that was conducted on 1886.  The second
is a relatively informal survey conducted by US Bureau of
Labor representatives in 1889, for use in official reports.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(cottonworkers)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 14 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>census1886</dt><dd><p>Numbers of workers in each of 14 different
categories, according to the Board of Trade wage census that
was conducted in 1886</p>
</dd>
<dt>survey1889</dt><dd><p>Numbers of workers in each of 14 different

manner, by approaching individuals on the street.  Biases might
therefore be expected.
