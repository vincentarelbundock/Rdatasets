<h2>Oxygen uptake versus mechanical power, for humans</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set from Daedalus project.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(humanpower1)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 28 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>wattsPerKg</dt><dd><p>a numeric vector: watts per kilogram of body weight</p>
</dd>
<dt>o2</dt><dd><p>a numeric vector: ml/min/kg</p>
</dd>
<dt>id</dt><dd><p>a factor with levels 1 - 5 (<code>humanpower1</code>)
or 1 - 4 (<code>humanpower2</code>), identifying the different athletes</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data in <code>humanpower1</code> are from investigations (Bussolari 1987)
designed to assess the feasibility of a proposed 119 kilometer human
powered flight from the island of Crete &ndash; in the initial phase of the
Daedalus project.  Data are for five athletes
&ndash; a female hockey player, a male amateur tri-athlete, a female
amateur triathlete, a male wrestler and a male cyclist &ndash; who were
selected from volunteers who were recruited through the news media,
Data in <code>humanpower2) are for four out of the 25 applicants who
    were selected for further testing, in the lead-up to the eventual
    selection of a pilot for the Daedalus project (Nadel and Bussolari 1988).
