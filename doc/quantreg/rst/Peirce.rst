         :name: c.s.-peirces-auditory-response-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from sequence experiments conducted by C.S. Pierce in 1872 to
      determine the distribution of response times to an auditory
      stimulus.

      A ``link{list}`` of 24 objects each representing one day of the
      experiment. Each element of the list consists of three components:
      the date the measurements were made, an ``x`` component recording
      the response time in milliseconds, and an associated ``y``
      component recording a count of the number of times that the
      response was recorded to be equal to be equal to the corresponding
      ``x`` entry. There are roughly 500 observations (counts) on each
      of the 24 days.

      A detailed description of the experiment can be found in Peirce
      (1873). A young man of about 18 with no prior experience was
      employed to respond to a signal “consisting of a sharp sound like
      a rap, the answer being made upon a telegraph-operator's key
      nicely adjusted.” The response times, made with the aid of a Hipp
      cronoscope were recorded to the nearest millisecond. The data was
      analyzed by Peirce who concluded that after the first day, when
      the the observer was entirely inexperienced, the curves
      representing the densities of the response times “differed very
      little from that derived from the theory of least squares,” i.e.
      from the Gaussian density.

      The data was subsequently analysed by Samama, in a diploma thesis
      supervised by Maurice Frechet, who reported briefly the findings
      in Frechet (1924), and by Wilson and Hilferty (1929). In both
      instances the reanalysis showed that Laplace's first law of error,
      the double exponential distribution, was a better representation
      for the data than was the Gaussian law. Koenker (2009) constains
      further discussion and an attempt to reproduce the Wilson and
      Hilferty analysis.

      The data is available in two formats: The first in a "raw" form as
      24 text files as scanned from the reprinted Peirce source, the
      second as an R dataset ``Peirce.rda`` containing the list. Only
      the latter is provided here, for the raw data and how to read see
      the more complete archive at:
      http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/research/frechet/frechet.html See
      the examples section below for some details on provisional attempt
      to reproduce part of the Wilson and Hilferty analysis. An open
      question regarding the dataset is: How did Wilson and Hilferty
      compute standard deviations for the median as they appear in their
      table? The standard textbook suggestion of Yule (1917) yields far
      too small a bandwidth. The methods employed in the example section
      below, which rely on relatively recent proposals, are somewhat
      closer, but still deviate somewhat from the results reported by
      Wilson and Hilferty.
