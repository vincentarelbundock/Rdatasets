         :name: garland1983-data-on-running-speed-of-mammals

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Observations on the maximal running speed of mammal species and
      their body mass.

         data(Mammals)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 107 observations on the following 4 variables.

      weight
         Body mass in Kg for "typical adult sizes"

      speed
         Maximal running speed (fastest sprint velocity on record)

      hoppers
         logical variable indicating animals that ambulate by hopping,
         e.g. kangaroos

      specials
         logical variable indicating special animals with "lifestyles in
         which speed does not figure as an important factor":
         Hippopotamus, raccoon (Procyon), badger (Meles), coati (Nasua),
         skunk (Mephitis), man (Homo), porcupine (Erithizon), oppossum
         (didelphis), and sloth (Bradypus)

      Used by Chappell (1989) and Koenker, Ng and Portnoy (1994) to
      illustrate the fitting of piecewise linear curves.
