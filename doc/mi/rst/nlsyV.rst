      A data frame with 400 randomly subsampled observations on the
      following 7 variables.

      ``ppvtr.36``
         a numeric vector with data on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
         Test (Revised) administered at 36 months

      ``first``
         indicator for whether child was first-born

      ``b.marr``
         indicator for whether mother was married when child was born

      ``income``
         a numeric vector with data on family income in year after the
         child was born

      ``momage``
         a numeric vector with data on the age of the mother when the
         child was born

      ``momed``
         educational status of mother when child was born (1 = less than
         high school, 2 = high school graduate, 3 = some college, 4 =
         college graduate)

      ``momrace``
         race of mother (1 = black, 2 = Hispanic, 3 = white)

      Note that **momed** would typically be an ordered ``factor`` while
      **momrace** would typically be an unorderd ``factor`` but both are
      ``numeric`` in this ``data.frame`` in order to illustrate the
      mechanism to ``change`` the type of a ``missing_variable``
