         :name: description

      Annual averages of the daily sunspot areas (in units of millionths
      of a hemisphere) for the full sun. Sunspots are magnetic regions
      that appear as dark spots on the surface of the sun. The Royal
      Greenwich Observatory compiled daily sunspot observations from May
      1874 to 1976. Later data are from the US Air Force and the US
      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The data have
      been calibrated to be consistent across the whole history of
      observations.
