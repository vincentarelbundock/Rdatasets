      :name: sunspotarea

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Annual averages of the daily sunspot areas (in units of millionths of
   a hemisphere) for the full sun. Sunspots are magnetic regions that
   appear as dark spots on the surface of the sun. The Royal Greenwich
   Observatory compiled daily sunspot observations from May 1874 to
   1976. Later data are from the US Air Force and the US National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The data have been calibrated
   to be consistent across the whole history of observations.
