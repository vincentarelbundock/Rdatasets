         Australia, in 2014
         :name: half-hourly-and-daily-electricity-demand-for-victoria-australia-in-2014

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      ``elecdemand`` is a half-hourly time series matrix with three
      columns:

      +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
      | Demand:      | Total electricity demand in GW for Victoria,         |
      |              | Australia, every half-hour during 2014.              |
      +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
      | WorkDay:     | taking value 1 on work days, and 0 otherwise.        |
      +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
      | Temperature: | half-hourly temperatures for Melbourne (BOM site     |
      |              | 086071).                                             |
      +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

      ``elecdaily`` is a daily time series matrix with three columns:

      +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
      | Demand:      | Total electricity demand in GW for Victoria,         |
      |              | Australia, every day during 2014.                    |
      +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
      | WorkDay:     | taking value 1 on work days, and 0 otherwise.        |
      +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
      | Temperature: | maximum daily temperatures for Melbourne (BOM site   |
      |              | 086071).                                             |

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      Multiple time series of class ``mts``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This data is for operational demand, which is the demand met by
      local scheduled generating units, semi-scheduled generating units,
      and non-scheduled intermittent generating units of aggregate
      capacity larger than 30 MW, and by generation imports to the
      region. The operational demand excludes the demand met by
      non-scheduled non-intermittent generating units, non-scheduled
      intermittent generating units of aggregate capacity smaller than
      30 MW, exempt generation (e.g. rooftop solar, gas tri-generation,
      very small wind farms, etc), and demand of local scheduled loads.
      It also excludes some very large industrial users (such as mines
      or smelters).
