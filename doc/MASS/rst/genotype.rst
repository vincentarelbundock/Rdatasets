      Data from a foster feeding experiment with rat mothers and litters
      of four different genotypes: ``A``, ``B``, ``I`` and ``J``. Rat
      litters were separated from their natural mothers at birth and
      given to foster mothers to rear.

      The data frame has the following components:

      ``Litter``
         genotype of the litter.

      ``Mother``
         genotype of the foster mother.

      ``Wt``
         Litter average weight gain of the litter, in grams at age 28
         days. (The source states that the within-litter variability is
         negligible.)
