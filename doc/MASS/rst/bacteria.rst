      This data frame has 220 rows and the following columns:

      y
         presence or absence: a factor with levels ``n`` and ``y``.

      ap
         active/placebo: a factor with levels ``a`` and ``p``.

      hilo
         hi/low compliance: a factor with levels ``hi`` amd ``lo``.

      week
         numeric: week of test.

      ID
         subject ID: a factor.

      trt
         a factor with levels ``placebo``, ``drug`` and ``drug+``, a
         re-coding of ``ap`` and ``hilo``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Dr A. Leach tested the effects of a drug on 50 children with a
      history of otitis media in the Northern Territory of Australia.
      The children were randomized to the drug or the a placebo, and
      also to receive active encouragement to comply with taking the
      drug.

      The presence of *H. influenzae* was checked at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6
      and 11: 30 of the checks were missing and are not included in this
      data frame.
