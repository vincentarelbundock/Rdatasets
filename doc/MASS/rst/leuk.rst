      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A data frame of data from 33 leukaemia patients.

      .. rubric:: Usage

         leuk

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with columns:

      ``wbc``
         white blood count.

      ``ag``
         a test result, ``"present"`` or ``"absent"``.

      ``time``
         survival time in weeks.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Survival times are given for 33 patients who died from acute
      myelogenous leukaemia. Also measured was the patient's white blood
      cell count at the time of diagnosis. The patients were also
      factored into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of a
      morphologic characteristic of white blood cells. Patients termed
      AG positive were identified by the presence of Auer rods and/or
      significant granulation of the leukaemic cells in the bone marrow
      at the time of diagnosis.
