      .. rubric:: Eighth-Grade Pupils in the Netherlands
         :name: eighth-grade-pupils-in-the-netherlands

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Snijders and Bosker (1999) use as a running example a study of
      2287 eighth-grade pupils (aged about 11) in 132 classes in 131
      schools in the Netherlands. Only the variables used in our
      examples are supplied.

      This data frame contains 2287 rows and the following columns:

      ``lang``
         language test score.

      ``IQ``
         verbal IQ.

      ``class``
         class ID.

      ``GS``
         class size: number of eighth-grade pupils recorded in the class
         (there may be others: see ``COMB``, and some may have been
         omitted with missing values).

      ``SES``
         social-economic status of pupil's family.

      ``COMB``
         were the pupils taught in a multi-grade class (``0/1``)?
         Classes which contained pupils from grades 7 and 8 are coded
         ``1``, but only eighth-graders were tested.
