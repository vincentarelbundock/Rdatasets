      .. rubric:: Tests of Auditory Perception in Children with OME
         :name: tests-of-auditory-perception-in-children-with-ome

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Experiments were performed on children on their ability to
      differentiate a signal in broad-band noise. The noise was played
      from a pair of speakers and a signal was added to just one
      channel; the subject had to turn his/her head to the channel with
      the added signal. The signal was either coherent (the amplitude of
      the noise was increased for a period) or incoherent (independent
      noise was added for the same period to form the same increase in
      power).

      The threshold used in the original analysis was the stimulus
      loudness needs to get 75% correct responses. Some of the children
      had suffered from otitis media with effusion (OME).

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      The ``OME`` data frame has 1129 rows and 7 columns:

      ``ID``
         Subject ID (1 to 99, with some IDs missing). A few subjects
         were measured at different ages.

      ``OME``
         ``"low"`` or ``"high"`` or ``"N/A"`` (at ages other than 30 and
         60 months).

      ``Age``
         Age of the subject (months).

      ``Loud``
         Loudness of stimulus, in decibels.

      ``Noise``
         Whether the signal in the stimulus was ``"coherent"`` or
         ``"incoherent"``.

      ``Correct``
         Number of correct responses from ``Trials`` trials.

      ``Trials``
         Number of trials performed.

      .. rubric:: Background
         :name: background

      The experiment was to study otitis media with effusion (OME), a
      very common childhood condition where the middle ear space, which
      is normally air-filled, becomes congested by a fluid. There is a
      concomitant fluctuating, conductive hearing loss which can result
      in various language, cognitive and social deficits. The term
      ‘binaural hearing’ is used to describe the listening conditions in
      which the brain is processing information from both ears at the
      same time. The brain computes differences in the intensity and/or
      timing of signals arriving at each ear which contributes to sound
      localisation and also to our ability to hear in background noise.

      Some years ago, it was found that children of 7–8 years with a
      history of significant OME had significantly worse binaural
      hearing than children without such a history, despite having
      equivalent sensitivity. The question remained as to whether it was
      the timing, the duration, or the degree of severity of the otitis
      media episodes during critical periods, which affected later
      binaural hearing. In an attempt to begin to answer this question,
      95 children were monitored for the presence of effusion every
      month since birth. On the basis of OME experience in their first
      two years, the test population was split into one group of high
      OME prevalence and one of low prevalence.
