      .. rubric:: Blood Pressure in Rabbits
         :name: blood-pressure-in-rabbits

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Five rabbits were studied on two occasions, after treatment with
      saline (control) and after treatment with the ``5-HT_3``
      antagonist MDL 72222. After each treatment ascending doses of
      phenylbiguanide were injected intravenously at 10 minute intervals
      and the responses of mean blood pressure measured. The goal was to
      test whether the cardiogenic chemoreflex elicited by
      phenylbiguanide depends on the activation of ``5-HT_3`` receptors.
