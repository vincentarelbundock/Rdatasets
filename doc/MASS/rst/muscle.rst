      .. rubric:: Effect of Calcium Chloride on Muscle Contraction in
         Rat Hearts
         :name: effect-of-calcium-chloride-on-muscle-contraction-in-rat-hearts

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The purpose of this experiment was to assess the influence of
      calcium in solution on the contraction of heart muscle in rats.
      The left auricle of 21 rat hearts was isolated and on several
      occasions a constant-length strip of tissue was electrically
      stimulated and dipped into various concentrations of calcium
      chloride solution, after which the shortening of the strip was
      accurately measured as the response.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``Strip``
         which heart muscle strip was used?

      ``Conc``
         concentration of calcium chloride solution, in multiples of 2.2
         mM.

      ``Length``
         the change in length (shortening) of the strip, (allegedly) in
         mm.
