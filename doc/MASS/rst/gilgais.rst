      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset was collected on a line transect survey in gilgai
      territory in New South Wales, Australia. Gilgais are natural
      gentle depressions in otherwise flat land, and sometimes seem to
      be regularly distributed. The data collection was stimulated by
      the question: are these patterns reflected in soil properties? At
      each of 365 sampling locations on a linear grid of 4 meters
      spacing, samples were taken at depths 0-10 cm, 30-40 cm and 80-90
      cm below the surface. pH, electrical conductivity and chloride
      content were measured on a 1:5 soil:water extract from each
      sample.
