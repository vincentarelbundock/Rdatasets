         :name: description

      This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of
      Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. He
      assessed biopsies of breast tumours for 699 patients up to 15 July
      1992; each of nine attributes has been scored on a scale of 1 to
      10, and the outcome is also known. There are 699 rows and 11
      columns.
