      The ``Sitka89`` data frame has 632 rows and 4 columns. It gives
      repeated measurements on the log-size of 79 Sitka spruce trees, 54
      of which were grown in ozone-enriched chambers and 25 were
      controls. The size was measured eight times in 1989, at roughly
      monthly intervals.
