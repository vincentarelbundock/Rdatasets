      .. rubric:: Snail Mortality Data
         :name: snail-mortality-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Groups of 20 snails were held for periods of 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks in
      carefully controlled conditions of temperature and relative
      humidity. There were two species of snail, A and B, and the
      experiment was designed as a 4 by 3 by 4 by 2 completely
      randomized design. At the end of the exposure time the snails were
      tested to see if they had survived; the process itself is fatal
      for the animals. The object of the exercise was to model the
      probability of survival in terms of the stimulus variables, and in
      particular to test for differences between species.

      The data are unusual in that in most cases fatalities during the
      experiment were fairly small.
