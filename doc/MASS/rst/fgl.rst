      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``RI``
         refractive index; more precisely the refractive index is
         1.518xxxx.

         The next 8 measurements are percentages by weight of oxides.

      ``Na``
         sodium.

      ``Mg``
         manganese.

      ``Al``
         aluminium.

      ``Si``
         silicon.

      ``K``
         potassium.

      ``Ca``
         calcium.

      ``Ba``
         barium.

      ``Fe``
         iron.

      ``type``
         The fragments were originally classed into seven types, one of
         which was absent in this dataset. The categories which occur
         are window float glass (``WinF``: 70), window non-float glass
         (``WinNF``: 76), vehicle window glass (``Veh``: 17), containers
         (``Con``: 13), tableware (``Tabl``: 9) and vehicle headlamps
         (``Head``: 29).
