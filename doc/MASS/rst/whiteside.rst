      .. rubric:: House Insulation: Whiteside's Data
         :name: house-insulation-whitesides-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Mr Derek Whiteside of the UK Building Research Station recorded
      the weekly gas consumption and average external temperature at his
      own house in south-east England for two heating seasons, one of 26
      weeks before, and one of 30 weeks after cavity-wall insulation was
      installed. The object of the exercise was to assess the effect of
      the insulation on gas consumption.

      The ``whiteside`` data frame has 56 rows and 3 columns.:

      ``Insul``
         A factor, before or after insulation.

      ``Temp``
         Purportedly the average outside temperature in degrees Celsius.
         (These values is far too low for any 56-week period in the
         1960s in South-East England. It might be the weekly average of
         daily minima.)

      ``Gas``
         The weekly gas consumption in 1000s of cubic feet.
