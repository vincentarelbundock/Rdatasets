         :name: description

      The ``Sitka`` data frame has 395 rows and 4 columns. It gives
      repeated measurements on the log-size of 79 Sitka spruce trees, 54
      of which were grown in ozone-enriched chambers and 25 were
      controls. The size was measured five times in 1988, at roughly
      monthly intervals.
