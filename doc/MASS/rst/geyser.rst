      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A version of the eruptions data from the ‘Old Faithful’ geyser in
      Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. This version comes from
      Azzalini and Bowman (1990) and is of continuous measurement from
      August 1 to August 15, 1985.

      Some nocturnal duration measurements were coded as 2, 3 or 4
      minutes, having originally been described as ‘short’, ‘medium’ or
      ‘long’.
