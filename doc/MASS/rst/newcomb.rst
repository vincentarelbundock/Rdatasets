   .. rubric:: Newcomb's Measurements of the Passage Time of Light
      :name: newcomb

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   A numeric vector giving the ‘Third Series’ of measurements of the
   passage time of light recorded by Newcomb in 1882. The given values
   divided by 1000 plus 24.8 give the time in millionths of a second for
   light to traverse a known distance. The ‘true’ value is now
   considered to be 33.02.

   The dataset is given in the order in Staudte and Sheather. Stigler
   (1977, Table 5) gives the dataset as

   ::

          28 26 33 24 34 -44 27 16 40 -2 29 22 24 21 25 30 23 29 31 19
          24 20 36 32 36 28 25 21 28 29 37 25 28 26 30 32 36 26 30 22
          36 23 27 27 28 27 31 27 26 33 26 32 32 24 39 28 24 25 32 25
          29 27 28 29 16 23

   However, order is not relevant to its use as an example of robust
   estimation. (Thanks to Anthony Unwin for bringing this difference to
   our attention.)
