      .. rubric:: Newcomb's Measurements of the Passage Time of Light
         :name: newcombs-measurements-of-the-passage-time-of-light

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A numeric vector giving the ‘Third Series’ of measurements of the
      passage time of light recorded by Newcomb in 1882. The given
      values divided by 1000 plus 24.8 give the time in millionths of a
      second for light to traverse a known distance. The ‘true’ value is
      now considered to be 33.02.

      The dataset is given in the order in Staudte and Sheather. Stigler
      (1977, Table 5) gives the dataset as

      ::

             28 26 33 24 34 -44 27 16 40 -2 29 22 24 21 25 30 23 29 31 19
             24 20 36 32 36 28 25 21 28 29 37 25 28 26 30 32 36 26 30 22
             36 23 27 27 28 27 31 27 26 33 26 32 32 24 39 28 24 25 32 25
             29 27 28 29 16 23

      However, order is not relevant to its use as an example of robust
      estimation. (Thanks to Anthony Unwin for bringing this difference
      to our attention.)
