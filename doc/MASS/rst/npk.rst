         :name: classical-n-p-k-factorial-experiment

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A classical N, P, K (nitrogen, phosphate, potassium) factorial
      experiment on the growth of peas conducted on 6 blocks. Each half
      of a fractional factorial design confounding the NPK interaction
      was used on 3 of the plots.

      ::

         npk

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      The ``npk`` data frame has 24 rows and 5 columns:

      ``block``
         which block (label 1 to 6).

      ``N``
         indicator (0/1) for the application of nitrogen.

      ``P``
         indicator (0/1) for the application of phosphate.

      ``K``
         indicator (0/1) for the application of potassium.

      ``yield``
         Yield of peas, in pounds/plot (the plots were (1/70) acre).
