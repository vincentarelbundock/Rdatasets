<h2>Death Penalty and Race in Georgia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains data collected by lawyers on convicted Black murderers in the state of Georgia.
The goal was to examine whether convicted Black murderers whose victim was white were more likely to
receive the death penalty compared to those whose victim was Black, accounting for the level of
aggravation of the crime.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(DeathPenaltyRace_df)
</code></pre>

<p>A data frame with 12 observations and 4 variables:
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset name has been changed to 'DeathPenaltyRace_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets
in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
crimedatasets package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics. The suffix
