      The dataset name has been changed to 'crimtab_table' to avoid
      confusion with other data sets in the R ecosystem. This naming
      convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
      crimedatasets package and assists users in identifying its
      specific characteristics. The suffix 'table' indicates that the
      dataset is stored as a contingency table, rather than a
      traditional data frame. The original content has not been modified
      in any way.
