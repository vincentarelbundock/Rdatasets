<h2>Voting Intentions in the 1988 Chilean Plebiscite</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set on voting intentions in the 1988 Chilean plebiscite, which
ultimately ended the military junta rule of Augusto Pinochet.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>chile88
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2700 observations on the following 8 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>region</code></dt><dd><p>a character vector for the region of Chile in which the respondent lives</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pop</code></dt><dd><p>the population size of the respondent's community</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sex</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector that equals 1 if the respondent is a woman</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>age</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the age of the respondent</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>educ</code></dt><dd><p>a character vector indicating whether the respondent has a primary (P), secondary (S), or post-secondary (PS) education</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>income</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for respondent's monthly income (in pesos)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sq</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the scale of support for the status quo in Chile</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>vote</code></dt><dd><p>a character vector for the vote intention of the respondent (see details)</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data were manually downloaded from John Fox's website. You will see
his version of these data as <code>Chile</code> in the <span class="pkg">carData</span> package. I
changed a few things that are ultimately cosmetic. It's basically this data
set.
</p>
<p>The vote variable communicates vote intentions, whether to vote &quot;Yes&quot; (Y) to
continue the Pinochet regime, to vote &quot;No&quot; (N) to end the Pinochet regime, to
abstain (A) from a vote, or whether the respondent is undecided (U). 168
respondents did not answer the question.
</p>
<p>Fox (2008, 336) does not say much about the status quo variable, and on what
scale it is. It can only be easily inferred that higher values = more support
for the status quo.
</p>
<p>You may find it in your interest to relabel the &quot;region&quot; variable. In these
data, the regions are Central (&quot;C&quot;), Metropolitan Santiago area (&quot;M&quot;), North
(&quot;N&quot;), South (&quot;S&quot;), and the city of Santiago (&quot;SA&quot;).
</p>
<p>More information about the underlying source of the data would be more than
welcome. Any information about these data, beyond the kind of R documentation
files about its pedagogical use, is hard to find. This is a roundabout way of
saying be cautious about any &quot;real-world&quot; use of these data beyond
learning statistical methods. That is ultimately its intended use.
