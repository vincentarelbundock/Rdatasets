<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data come <code>oddschecker.com</code> as of Oct. 20, 2024, assuming these
are preseason odds. Raw data are available on the project's website for your
consideration. Don't bet on sports, unless you've been visited by Biff Tannen
from the future.
</p>
<p>Fractions have been converted into decimals for ease of maintaining the data.
Raw odds (in fraction form) for those clubs most likely to be relegated are
available in the raw data files on the project's Github.
</p>
<p>Odds are typically(?) communicated as &quot;odds against&quot; in the sports betting
world. It's why the highest odds for relegation and lowest odds for winning
coincide with the biggest, most successful clubs. Context clues help, and are
useful for understanding what these odds are saying.
</p>
<p>It's possible that the language &quot;win outright&quot; is doing some heavy-lifting in
how Bet365 lets you place wagers on winning the table.
</p>
<p>I'm also aware of the reason these odds do not sum to 1, and in fact exceed
</p>

<li><p> If anything, I think &quot;overrounding&quot; is its own pedagogical tool for why
odds can be wonky things to learn in relation to its use in the statistical
modeling context.
