<h2>Cross-National Rates of Trade Union Density</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cross-national data on relative size of the trade unions and predictors in 20 countries.
This is a data set of interest to replicating Western and Jackman (1994),
who themselves were addressing a debate between Wallerstein and Stephens on
which of two highly correlated predictors explains trade union density.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>uniondensity
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>country</code></dt><dd><p>a character vector for the country</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>union</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the percentage of the total number of
wage and salary earners plus the unemployed who are union members, measured
between 1975 and 1980, with most of the data drawn from 1979.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>left</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector tapping the extent to which parties of
the left have controlled governments since 1919, due to Wilensky (1981).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>size</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector measuring the log of labor force size,
defined as the number of wage and salary earners, plus the unemployed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>concen</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector measuring the percentage of employment,
shipments, or production accounted for by the four largest enterprises in
a particular industry, averaged over industries (with weights proportional
to the size of the industry) and the resulting measure is normalized such
that the United States scores a 1.0, and is due to Pryor (1973).
Some of the scores on this variable are imputed using procedures
described in Stephens and Wallerstein (1991, 945).</p>

I just tidied up the presentation a bit.
