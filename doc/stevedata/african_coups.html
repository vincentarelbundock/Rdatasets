<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set on modeling coups in Africa using data from the period between
1960 and 1975 (1982). These data offer a partial replication of Jackman
(1978).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data exist for instructional purposes, especially about modeling interactions.
Reading Jackman (1978) and Johnson et al. (1984) will provide more information
about the data and hypotheses. There was a follow-up symposium on this in
1986 in <em>American Political Science Review</em> that may be an interesting
read and provide even more context about what's at stake in this debate.
</p>
<p>English country names are country names from around the time of publication.
Take note of older names of &quot;Dahomey&quot;, &quot;Swaziland&quot;, &quot;Upper Volta&quot;, and &quot;Zaire.&quot;
The three-character ISO codes are current, mostly for ease of doing other
things with the data. However, this comes with the acknowledgment that
Dahomey and Zaire used to have different ISO codes under their older names.
Both codes for Dahomey (<code>DHY</code>) and Zaire (<code>ZAR</code>) were retired in 1977 and
1997, respectively.
</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd have Morrison's (1972) <em>Black Africa</em>, but I do not. I have
a copy of a 1989 update, though. That's what I consulted in constructing
this data set.
</p>
<p>Jackman (1978) is deceptively opaque on what he's doing for the ethnic group
variable and arguably misleads on what his turnout variable is actually from.
In the case of the ethnic group variable, it's the difference between saying
the largest ethnic group in Rwanda is 98% of the population versus 80% of
the population. In short, it's the difference of saying whether there are
any Tutsi at all in the country. Basically, I'm uncertain with what he's
doing with what Morrison et al. (1989) define as &quot;ethnic clusters&quot;.
</p>
<p>Related: the agricultural variable is a midway point between columns B and
columns C in Table 3.11 of Morrison et al. (1989). I do not think this is too
far removed from what Jackman was looking at in an older version of the same
data, but there will be slight differences. It's the difference of &quot;these
variables came from 1966&quot; versus &quot;this is an interpolation of 1960 to 1970&quot;.
The latter is what I offer here. I can only do so much.
</p>
<p>To continue this theme of the opacity in trying to reconstruct the data,
Jackman (1978, p. 1265) says his social mobilization index incorporates the
percentage of the labor force that is not employed in agriculture. The
summary statistics he provides in fn. 4 on p. 1265 are consistent with this,
at least (for the most part) in this reconstruction of the data. However,
other statistical results and other language from Jackman are consistent with
him using the percentage of the labor force that is employed in industry.
This is not a trivial distinction either. Using the percentage of the
country's labor force in industry would, in a literal sense, not strictly
be &quot;the simple sum of the percentage of the labor force in nonagricultural
occupations&quot;. It would exclude those working in service industries. The
data provide the opportunity to use either the industrial percentage variable
or to manually create a non-agricultural labor force percentage variable as
the difference between 100 and the agricultural labor force percentage
variable. It makes the most sense to do the latter. The industry percentage
variable comes from Table 3.14 in Morrison et al. (1989) and is likewise a
midway point between 1960 and 1970.
</p>
<p>Mercifully, the coup variables come from a replication by Johnson et al.
(1984). Based on Morrison et al.'s (1989) updated data, it's not clear how
Jackman could've derived some of these estimates using the formula he said
he used. For example, Benin should have a score of 39 based on the
information in Table 2.10 (p. 373 in Morrison et al. (1989)). Cameroon should
have a 1 and not a 2, per Table 5.10 (p. 399). My comments here work under
the assumption that Morrison et al. are adding information and not revising
information in the second edition of the <em>Black Africa</em> handbook.
</p>
<p>To be more precise, both the Jackman coup index and total military involvement
variables are directly copied from Table 2 in Johnson et al. (1984) on p. 627.
Missingness in the Jackman coup index variable communicates the country was
not included in his original study, but was included in the Johnson et al.
replication.
</p>
<p>The literacy variables have suffices communicating where I obtained them. The
Cross-National Time Series Database has a variable effectively communicating
this information that I was using first in trying to recreate these data.
These data come from 1965 in that data set. Jackman and Johnson et al. are
assuredly using Morrison's almanac. That information is in Table 4.11 of
Morrison et al. (1989), though it's possible the estimates contained therein
are slightly different than what was reported in the first edition. I cannot
know for sure.
</p>
<p>Ethiopia is conspicuously missing in the party dominance variable. That's by
design, and apparently its omission warranted ample discussion both by
Jackman (1978) and Johnson et al. (1984). Johnson et al. (1984, fns. 4,5)
argue it's a curious choice that can situationally influence the results that
Jackman reports, but there are also lots of other choices made by Jackman
(1978) that can influence these results.
</p>
<p>I am 99.9% sure the turnout variable is Table 5.9 in Morrison et al. (1989).
Jackman (1978) says this is from <em>before</em> independence but I'm confident he
meant it was the turnout at the independence referendum.
