<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The major party thermometer index is calculated as the thermometer rating for the
Democratic party minus the thermometer rating for the Republican party. 100 is then added to that difference, which is then divided by 2.
Fractional results are rounded to the next highest integer. Also note the coding of the &quot;government distrust&quot; measures. These are reverse-coded
from their original scales.
