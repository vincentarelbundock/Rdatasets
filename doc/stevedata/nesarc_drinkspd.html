<h2>The Usual Daily Drinking Habits of Americans (NESARC, 2001-2)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This toy data set is loosely modified from Wave I of the NESARC data set.
Here, my main interest is the number of drinks consumed on a usual day drinking
alcohol in the past 12 months, according to respondents in the nationally
representative survey of 43,093 Americans.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>nesarc_drinkspd
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 43093 observations on the following 8 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>idnum</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector and sequence from 1 to the number of rows in the data</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ethrace2a</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the ethnicity/race. 1 = White, not Hispanic. 2 = Black, not Hispanic. 3 = AI/AN. 4 = Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander. 5 = Hispanic or Latino.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>region</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the Census region. 1 = Northeast. 2 = Midwest. 3 = South. 4 = West</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>age</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for age in years</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sex</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for sex. 1 = female. 0 = male</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>marital</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for marital status. 1 = married. 2 = living with someone as married. 3 = widowed. 4 = divorced. 5 = separated. 6 = never married</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>educ</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for education level, recoded from <code>s1q6a</code> in the original data. 1 = did not make it to/finish high school. 2 = high school graduate or equivalency. 3 = some college, but no four-year degree. 4 = four-year college degree or more.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>s2aq8b</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the number of drinks of any alcohol consumed on days drinking alcohol in the past 12 months. This variable is &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; from the original data set.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>You will not want to use the <code>s2aq8b</code> variable without recoding it first.
Those who cannot recall how much they typically drink (i.e. true &ldquo;don't knows&rdquo;
or missing info) are coded as 99. Non-drinkers are coded as <code>NA</code> in the <code>s2aq8b</code>
variable and should be recoded as 0. Any value between 1 and 98 in the variable represents the,
for lack of better term, &ldquo;true&rdquo; number of alcoholic drinks a respondent says s/he typically
consumes on a day drinking alcohol in the past 12 months, though this is evidently preposterous
as a count variable. A person drinking 42 alcoholic drinks a day would not be alive to tell you
they did this. The researcher may want to employ some sensible right censoring here.
