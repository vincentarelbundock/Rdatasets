      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      All population totals reflect those 10 years or older. The 1930
      Census (along with Robinson (1950)) uses "negro" in lieu of black,
      but the variable names here eschew that older label. Note that
      some states are not yet states in the 1930 Census.
