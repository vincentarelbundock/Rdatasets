      :name: description

   A data set on government spending in select rich countries as a
   function of trade/GDP, financial openness, and the state-year-level
   engagement in trade unions. The data offer a means to quasi-replicate
   Garrett's (1998) argument about left-wing governments' ability to
   stem the tide of globalization's effect on decreased government
   spending.

   A data frame with the following 9 variables.

   ``country``
      a character vector for the country

   ``iso3c``
      a character vector for the three-character country ISO code

   ``year``
      the year

   ``govtspendgdp``
      total government spending over GDP

   ``tradegdp``
      the volume of trade over GDP

   ``kaopen``
      an index measuring a country's degree of capital account openness

   ``ka_open``
      an alternate index measuring a country's degree of capital account
      openness, normalized to be between 0 and 1

   ``v2catrauni``
      an estimate of a country's engagement in independent trade unions,
      generated by way of a Bayesian item response model

   ``v2catrauni_ord``
      an estimate of a country's engagement in independent trade unions,
      on ordinal scale. See details.

   The data are an unbalanced panel because of data missingness
   primarily affecting Switzerland (which would only appear in the panel
   in earnest starting in the mid-1990s). The Netherlands has some
   missing data in the mid-1970s. Spain and Portugal appear at the start
   of the panel, though the transition to democracy for both wouldn't
   start until 1974/1975. The data also have some obvious COVID
   weirdness for 2020. Perhaps an honest re-assessment of Garrett (1998)
   may want to drop Switzerland altogether, ignore 2020, and lop a few
   years off the Spanish and Portuguese panel. What you do with the
   Netherlands is up to you.

   Briefly: the government spending/GDP data come from the International
   Monetary Fund. The trade/GDP data come from the World Bank's API. The
   financial openness indicators come by way of the Chinn-Ito index. The
   engagement in trade unions data are from the Varieties of Democracy
   project. The ordinal measure of the trade union estimates communicate
   what percentage of the population is active in independent trade
   unions. Values include 0) virtually no one 1) a small share of the
   population (less than 5 moderate share of the population (about 5 to
   15 the population (about 16 (about 26
