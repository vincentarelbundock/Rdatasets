         :name: description

      A data set on government spending in select rich countries as a
      function of trade/GDP, financial openness, and the
      state-year-level engagement in trade unions (among other things).
      The data offer a means to assess Garrett's (1998) argument about
      left-wing governments' ability to stem the tide of globalization's
      effect on decreased government spending. Data also draw
      inspiration from Rodrik (1998) and Garrett (2001).

      A data frame with the following variables.

      ``country``
         a character vector for the country

      ``iso3c``
         a character vector for the three-character country ISO code

      ``year``
         the year

      ``govtspendgdp``
         total government spending over GDP

      ``tradegdp``
         the volume of trade over GDP

      ``kaopen``
         an index measuring a country's degree of capital account
         openness

      ``ka_open``
         an alternate index measuring a country's degree of capital
         account openness, normalized to be between 0 and 1

      ``v2catrauni``
         an estimate of a country's engagement in independent trade
         unions, generated by way of a Bayesian item response model

      ``v2catrauni_ord``
         an estimate of a country's engagement in independent trade
         unions, on ordinal scale. See details.

      ``ud``
         union density, as a percentage (i.e. union members/working
         employees)

      ``urbanperc``
         the percentage of the population living in urban areas)

      ``gdppc``
         GDP per capita, in constant 2015 USD

      ``tpop``
         total population size, in units of individual humans

      ``depratio``
         dependency ratio (see details)

      The data are an unbalanced panel with assorted quirks during its
      construction. Data missingness affecting Switzerland means it
      would only appear in the panel starting in the mid-1990s. The
      Netherlands has some missing data in the mid-1970s. Spain and
      Portugal appear at the start of the panel, though the transition
      to democracy for both wouldn't start until 1974/1975. Union
      density coverage is spotty for states like Greece and Portugal.
      The data also have some obvious COVID weirdness for 2020. Use that
      to inform whatever case or variable selection you would like to
      do. It may make sense to employ a temporal domain of something
      like 1980 to 2005, or whatever. I don't know. There's also the
      issue of what to do about the recession.

      The dependency ratio is defined as the population aged 0-14, or 65
      and above, divided over the "working-age" population of 15-64 (x
      100).

      Briefly: the government spending/GDP data come from the
      International Monetary Fund. The trade/GDP data come from the
      World Bank's API, as do the population, GDP per capita, and
      urbanization data (see their details). The more conventional union
      density data come from OECD/ICWSS. The financial openness
      indicators come by way of the Chinn-Ito index. The engagement in
      trade unions data are from the Varieties of Democracy project. The
      ordinal measure of the trade union estimates communicate what
      percentage of the population is active in independent trade
      unions. Values include 0) virtually no one 1) a small share of the
      population (less than 5%), 2) A moderate share of the population
      (about 5 to 15%). 3) A large share of the population (about 16 %
      to 25%). 4) A very large share of the population (about 26% or
      more).
