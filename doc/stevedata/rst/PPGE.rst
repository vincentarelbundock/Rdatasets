         :name: description

      A data set on government spending in select rich countries as a
      function of trade/GDP, financial openness, and the
      state-year-level engagement in trade unions. The data offer a
      means to quasi-replicate Garrett's (1998) argument about left-wing
      governments' ability to stem the tide of globalization's effect on
      decreased government spending.

      A data frame with the following 9 variables.

      ``country``
         a character vector for the country

      ``iso3c``
         a character vector for the three-character country ISO code

      ``year``
         the year

      ``govtspendgdp``
         total government spending over GDP

      ``tradegdp``
         the volume of trade over GDP

      ``kaopen``
         an index measuring a country's degree of capital account
         openness

      ``ka_open``
         an alternate index measuring a country's degree of capital
         account openness, normalized to be between 0 and 1

      ``v2catrauni``
         an estimate of a country's engagement in independent trade
         unions, generated by way of a Bayesian item response model

      ``v2catrauni_ord``
         an estimate of a country's engagement in independent trade
         unions, on ordinal scale. See details.

      The data are an unbalanced panel because of data missingness
      primarily affecting Switzerland (which would only appear in the
      panel in earnest starting in the mid-1990s). The Netherlands has
      some missing data in the mid-1970s. Spain and Portugal appear at
      the start of the panel, though the transition to democracy for
      both wouldn't start until 1974/1975. The data also have some
      obvious COVID weirdness for 2020. Perhaps an honest re-assessment
      of Garrett (1998) may want to drop Switzerland altogether, ignore
      2020, and lop a few years off the Spanish and Portuguese panel.
      What you do with the Netherlands is up to you.

      Briefly: the government spending/GDP data come from the
      International Monetary Fund. The trade/GDP data come from the
      World Bank's API. The financial openness indicators come by way of
      the Chinn-Ito index. The engagement in trade unions data are from
      the Varieties of Democracy project. The ordinal measure of the
      trade union estimates communicate what percentage of the
      population is active in independent trade unions. Values include
      0) virtually no one 1) a small share of the population (less than
      5%), 2) A moderate share of the population (about 5 to 15%). 3) A
      large share of the population (about 16 % to 25%). 4) A very large
      share of the population (about 26% or more).
