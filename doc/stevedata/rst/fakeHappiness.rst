         :name: fake-data-on-happiness

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This is a toy ("fake") data set I might use to illustrate the
      so-called curvilinear effect of age on happiness.

      .. rubric:: Format

      A data frame with 1000 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``age``
         a numeric vector for age.

      ``female``
         a numeric that equals 1 if the respondent is a woman

      ``collegeed``
         a numeric vector that equals 1 if the respondent says s/he has
         a college degree

      ``famincr``
         a numeric vector for the respondent's household income. Ranges
         from 1 to 12.

      ``bornagain``
         a numeric vector for whether the respondent self-identifies as
         a born-again Christian.

      ``e``
         random noise, generated from a normal distribution with a mean
         of 0 and a standard deviation of 3

      ``happy``
         an arbitrary happiness variable. See details for its
         construction

      ``z_happy``
         the same arbitrary happiness variable, scaled to have a mean of
         0 and a standard deviation of 1. This makes it seem more
         "latent".

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data are randomly sampled from the ``TV16`` data set in the same
      package for the age, female, college education, family income, and
      born-again variables. Thereafter, I created an arbitrary
      "happiness" variable that is equal to
      ``100 - .95*age + .01*(age^2) + .25*female + .05*famincr + .1*bornagain + e``.
      The data are not supposed to be realistic, per se. They're
      supposed to be functional for this purpose.
