      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Cross-national data on relative size of the trade unions and
      predictors in 20 countries. This is a data set of interest to
      replicating Western and Jackman (1994), who themselves were
      addressing a debate between Wallerstein and Stephens on which of
      two highly correlated predictors explains trade union density.

      A data frame with 20 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``country``
         a character vector for the country

      ``union``
         a numeric vector for the percentage of the total number of wage
         and salary earners plus the unemployed who are union members,
         measured between 1975 and 1980, with most of the data drawn
         from 1979.

      ``left``
         a numeric vector tapping the extent to which parties of the
         left have controlled governments since 1919, due to Wilensky
         (1981).

      ``size``
         a numeric vector measuring the log of labor force size, defined
         as the number of wage and salary earners, plus the unemployed.

      ``concen``
         a numeric vector measuring the percentage of employment,
         shipments, or production accounted for by the four largest
         enterprises in a particular industry, averaged over industries
         (with weights proportional to the size of the industry) and the
         resulting measure is normalized such that the United States
         scores a 1.0, and is due to Pryor (1973). Some of the scores on
         this variable are imputed using procedures described in
         Stephens and Wallerstein (1991, 945).
