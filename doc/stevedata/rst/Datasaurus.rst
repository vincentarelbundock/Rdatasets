The Datasaurus Dozen
--------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

An illustrative exercise in never trusting the summary statistics
without also visualizing them.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   Datasaurus

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 1,846 observations on the following 3 variables.

``dataset``
   the particular data set, one of 12

``x``
   a random variable

``y``
   another random variable

Details
~~~~~~~

Data were created by Alberto Cairo to illustrate you should always
visualize your data beyond the summary statistics. These are 12 data
sets, in long form, each with a mean of ``x`` about 54.26, a mean of
``y`` about 47.83. The standard deviation for ``x`` is about 16.76 and
the standard deviation of ``y`` is about 26.93. ``x`` and ``y`` will
correlate weakly, about -.06.
