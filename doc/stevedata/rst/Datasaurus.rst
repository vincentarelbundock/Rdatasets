      A data frame with 1,846 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``dataset``
         the particular data set, one of 12

      ``x``
         a random variable

      ``y``
         another random variable

      Data were created by Alberto Cairo to illustrate you should always
      visualize your data beyond the summary statistics. These are 12
      data sets, in long form, each with a mean of ``x`` about 54.26, a
      mean of ``y`` about 47.83. The standard deviation for ``x`` is
      about 16.76 and the standard deviation of ``y`` is about 26.93.
      ``x`` and ``y`` will correlate weakly, about -.06.
