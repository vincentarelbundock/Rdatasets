         :name: description

      The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory has an "ozone depleting
      gas index" (ODGI) data set from 1992 to 2018. This dataset
      summarizes Table 1 and Table 2 from its website. The primary
      interest here (for my purposes) is the ODGI indices (including the
      new 2012 measure). The data set includes constituent greenhouse
      gases/chlorines as well in parts per trillion. The primary use
      here is for in-class illustration.
