      A data frame on the following 3 variables.

      ``country``

      ``iso2c``
         a two-character code for the country/territorial unit

      ``cat``
         a category indicator for the country/territorial unit. See
         Details section for more.

      The ISO two-character code for Kosovo is not "XK". XK is a "user
      assigned" ISO 3166 code that is not used by the International
      Organization for Standardization, but is nevertheless in wide use
      by entities like the European Commission. To the best of my
      knowledge, Kosovo's official ISO classification is still what it
      was when it was a subdivision of Serbia/Yugoslavia.

      A glossary on Eurostat provides the following category entries
      included in this data frame. "EU" is an European Union member.
      "EFTA" are countries outside the European Union, but still
      included in the free trade agreement. "UK" is the United Kingdom,
      because they left. "EUCC" is a category for European Union
      candidate countries. "PC" are potential candidates. European Union
      expansion led to the delineation of neighboring states to "South"
      and "East" as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).
      "OEC" stands for "Other European Countries", but is effectively a
      simple indicator for Russia.
