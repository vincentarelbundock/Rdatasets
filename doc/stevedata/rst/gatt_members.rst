      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 128 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``country``
         a character vector for a country name

      ``iso3c``
         a three-character ISO code

      ``date``
         the date the country joined GATT

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data come from the World Trade Organization. Three-character ISO
      codes should be used with some caution as they mostly match what
      these states are now, if not what they were when they signed GATT
      (see: Benin, Democratic Republic of Congo). The conspicuous
      exception here is Yugoslavia, which has Yugoslavia's
      three-character ISO code of ``YUG``
