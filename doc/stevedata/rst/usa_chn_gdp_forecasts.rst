      product (GDP), given current trends. It includes an OECD long-term
      GDP forecast from 2014, and forecasts from the ``forecast`` and
      ``prophet`` packages in R.

      are rudimentary and bare minimum forecasts based on previous
      values to that point. Notice the ``forecast`` forecasts have a
      prefix of ``f_`` and the ``prophet`` forecasts have a prefix of
