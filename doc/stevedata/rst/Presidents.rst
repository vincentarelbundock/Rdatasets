      A data frame with 45 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``president``
         the president

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      I scraped this from https://www.presidentsusa.net/presvplist.html.
      Data frame is capital-P "Presidents" to avoid a conflict with the
      ``presidents`` data frame from the ``datasets`` package.
