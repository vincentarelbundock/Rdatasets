         :name: description

      I cobbled together this data set of the professional clothes
      (polos, long-sleeve dress shirts, pants) in my closet, largely for
      illustration on the origins of apparel in the U.S. for an intro
      lecture on trade.

      A data frame with 86 observations on the following 4 variables.

         The brand of clothing (e.g. Apt. 9, Saddlebred)

         the color (and/or pattern) of the article of clothing

      ``origin``
         The country that produced the garment.

      If you must know, I do most of my clothes shopping at major
      retailers in the U.S. This is mostly Belk, J.C. Penney, and
      Kohl's. If that's you as well, the odds are good the distribution
      of my clothes will closely resemble yours. A recent move I made
      resulted in me donating a fair bit of my short-sleeved polo
      shirts. I did not buy any new shirts, though. Thus, I copied that
      information from a previous version of the data.
