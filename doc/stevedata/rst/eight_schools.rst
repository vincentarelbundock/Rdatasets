      You've all seen these before. These are the "eight schools" that
      everyone gets when being introduced to Bayesian programming. Here
      are the full data for your consideration, which you can use
      instead of awkwardly searching where the data are and copy-pasting
      them as a list. Every damn time, Steve.
