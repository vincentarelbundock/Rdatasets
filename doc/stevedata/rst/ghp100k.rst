      A data frame with 561 observations on the following 3 variables.

         a numeric vector for the estimated rate of gun homicide per
         100,000 people

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The reported, or calculated annual crude rate of completed,
      intentional homicide committed with a firearm, per 100,000
      population, in years descending.

      Where a jurisdiction's published count of 'annual homicide'
      includes cases of attempted (uncompleted) homicide, these figures
      have been disaggregated wherever possible.

      In the United States, this category is confused by inaccurate and
      conflicting data published, suppressed or labeled as unreliable by
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
      Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Suppression can result in
      zero values where in fact homicides did occur.

      Incomplete classification by local agencies can also result in a
      significant proportion of events being categorized as 'unknown
      cause' or similar.

      Before quoting these datasets, please follow the citation links
      for a description of the considerable differences between them and
      the reasons for data suppression.

      Where a rate is calculated by ``GunPolicy.org``, a matched
      population estimate is also cited.

      The aforementioned details come, copied and pasted, from
      ``GunPolicy.org``. As of my most recent check of these data (April
      2024), this agency appeared to close due to lack of funding. This
      is unfortunate, but it is worth noting for matters of
      reproducibility and the use of these data in applied research
      questions.
