   ``value``

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   The reported, or calculated annual crude rate of completed,
   intentional homicide committed with a firearm, per 100,000
   population, in years descending.

   Where a jurisdiction's published count of 'annual homicide' includes
   cases of attempted (uncompleted) homicide, these figures have been
   disaggregated wherever possible.

   In the United States, this category is confused by inaccurate and
   conflicting data published, suppressed or labeled as unreliable by
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Suppression can result in zero values
   where in fact homicides did occur.

   Incomplete classification by local agencies can also result in a
   significant proportion of events being categorized as 'unknown cause'
   or similar.

   Before quoting these datasets, please follow the citation links for a
   description of the considerable differences between them and the
   reasons for data suppression.

   Where a rate is calculated by ``GunPolicy.org``, a matched population
   estimate is also cited.
