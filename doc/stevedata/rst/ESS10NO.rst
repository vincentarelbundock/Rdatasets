      You'll want to convert the ``eu_vote`` variable into something
      usable. Possible values include "Remain Outside", "Join EU",
      "Don't Know", "Not Eligible", "Blank Ballot", "Refuse to Answer",
      "Wouldn't Vote". Perhaps it's reasonable to make this a dummy
      variable comparing those who want to join versus those who want
      Norway to remain outside the European Union.

      The data are edition 2.2 of the 10th round of European Social
      Survey, which was released for public consumption on 21 December
      2022.
