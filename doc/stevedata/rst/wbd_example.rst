      The idea for this data comes by way of a student encounter where
      we noticed this issue. Data were further generated by the
      wonderful WDI package. The underlying data come from the World
      Bank national accounts (GDP per capita), World Bank analyst
      estimates (human capital index), or the United Nations Population
      Division (life expectancy at birth).

      The human capital index is on a 0 to 1 scale.
