      A data frame with 2257 observations on the following 9 variables.

      ``uid``
         a unique identifier for the respondent

      ``stateabb``
         the state where the respondent lives (as an abbreviation)

      ``vote``
         whether the respondent voted (1 = yes; 0 = no)

      ``age``
         the age of the respondent

      ``educ``
         the education-level of the respondent. See details section for
         more.

      ``female``
         whether the respondent is a woman (1 = female; 0 = male)

      ``south``
         does the respondent live in the south (1 = yes; 0 = no)

      ``polint``
         the political interest of the respondent in the campaigns (-1 =
         not much interested; 0 = somewhat interested; 1 = very much
         interested)

      ``govrace``
         did the respondent's state have a gubernatorial election that
         same November (1 = yes; 0 = no)

      .. rubric:: Details

      The ``vote`` variable is deliberately coded where those with a
      value of 1 are respondents who said they voted and the ANES was
      able to confirm that with voter registration records. There are
      purportedly 85 responses in this raw variable where the respondent
      said they voted, but this could not be confirmed from registration
      records. Those cases are recorded as ``NA``. The ``educ`` variable
      ranges from 1 (finished 8th grade or less than that) to 10
      (respondent holds an advanced degree). The ``uid`` variable is a
      simple sequence variable ranging from 1 to 2257 and is calculated
      on the original 1984 time-series study (May 3, 1999 version)
      before other recoding was done. This should allow some
      reproducibility for an interested user.
