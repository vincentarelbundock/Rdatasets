      These data come from the 2016 CCES and allow interested students
      to model the individual correlates of the Trump vote in 2016.
      Code/analysis heavily indebted to a 2017 analysis I did on my blog
      (see references).

         for Trump in 2016.

      ``age``

         ``birthyr``, as it's coded in the CCES data.

      ``female``

         from 1 (Less than $10,000) to 12 ($150,000 or more).

      ``ideo``
         a numeric vector for the respondent's ideology on a
         liberal-conservative discrete scale. 1 = very liberal. 5 = very
         conservative.

      ``pid7na``
         a numeric vector for the respondent's partisanship on the
         familiar 1-7 scale. 1 = Strong Democrat. 7 = Strong Republican.
         Other party supporters (e.g. libertarians) are coded as NA.

         a born-again Christian.

      ``religimp``

         respondent. 1 = not at all important. 4 = very important.

      ``churchatd``
         a numeric vector for the extent of church attendance for the
         respondent. 1 = never. 6 = more than once a week.

      ``prayerfreq``
         a numeric vector for the frequency of prayer for the
         respondent. 1 = never. 7 = several times a day.

      ``angryracism``
         a numeric vector for how angry the respondent is that racism
         exists. 1 = strongly agree (i.e. is angry racism exists). 5 =
         strongly disagree.

      ``whiteadv``
         a numeric vector for agreement with statement that white people
         have advantages over others in the U.S. 1 = strongly agree. 5 =
         strongly disagree.

      ``fearraces``
         a numeric vector for agreement with statement that the
         respondent fears other races. 1 = strongly disagree. 5 =
         strongly agree.

         rare in the U.S. 1 = strongly disagree. 5 = strongly agree.

      ``lrelig``
         a numeric vector that serves as a latent estimate for
         religiosity from the ``bornagain``, ``religimp``,
         ``churchatd``, and ``prayerfreq`` variables. Higher values =
         more religiosity.

      ``lcograc``
         a numeric vector that serves as a latent estimate for cognitive
         racism. This is derived from the ``racerare`` and ``whiteadv``
         variables.

      ``lemprac``
         a numeric vector that serves as a latent estimate for
         empathetic racism. This is derived from the ``fearraces`` and
         ``angryracism`` variables.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The latent estimates for religiosity, cognitive racism, and
      empathetic racism come from a graded response model estimated in
      ``mirt``. The concepts of "cognitive racism" and "empathetic
      racism" come from DeSante and Smith.
