      Data were created in early 2017 for an upper-division course on
      quantitative methods. Educational attainment and division/region
      data come from the Census. Voter turnout/share data come from the
      Elections Project at George Mason University. GDP per capita
      estimates come from Bureau of Economic Analysis. Unemployment data
      come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and code to generate it
      was derived from a forthcoming publication of mine.
