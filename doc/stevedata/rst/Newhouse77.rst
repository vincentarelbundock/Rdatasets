      .. rubric:: Medical-Care Expenditure: A Cross-National Survey
         (Newhouse, 1977)
         :name: medical-care-expenditure-a-cross-national-survey-newhouse-1977

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These are the data in Newhouse's (1977) simple OLS model from
      1977. In his case, he's trying to explain medical care
      expenditures as a function of GDP per capita for these countries.
      It's probably the easiest OLS model I can find in print because
      Newhouse helpfully provides all the data in one simple table.
