      A data frame with 4530 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``country``
         a character vector for the country

      ``member``
         a numeric vector indicating whether the importer is or is not a
         member of the International Coffee Organization

      ``year``
         a numeric vector for the year

      ``value``
         a numeric vector for the coffee imports for all select
         importing countries (in thousand 60-kg bags)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data come from the International Coffee Organization, of which I
      feel I should be a member.

      Observations for the People's Republic of China are removed
      because those can be obtained by adding together the values for
      "Macao", "Hong Kong", and "China (Mainland)".

      The user may want to be mindful about when 0s in the value data
      are actually communicating that the entry did not exist at the
      time, or no longer exists. For example, there is no independent
      Armenia in 1990 (and whatever imports Armenia had are lumped into
      the USSR value for 1990). Likewise, the 0s for the USSR in 1992
      are communicating the USSR no longer exists that year and you
      should instead look into one of the constituent republics for the
      information you want. You may want to benchmark this information
      to some kind of state system membership data.
