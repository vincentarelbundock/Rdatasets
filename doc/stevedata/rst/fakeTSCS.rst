   .. rubric:: Fake Data for a Time-Series Cross-Section
      :name: fakeTSCS

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   This is a toy (i.e. "fake") data set created by the ``fabricatr``
   package. There are 100 observations for 25 hypothetical countries.
   The outcome ``y`` is a linear function of a baseline for each
   hypothetical country, plus a yearly growth trend as well as varying
   growth errors for each country. ``x1`` is supposed to have a linear
   effect of .5 on ``y``, all things considered. ``x2`` is supposed to
   have a linear effect of 1 on ``y`` for each unit change in ``x2``,
   all things considered.

      :name: format

   A data frame with 2500 observations on the following 8 variables.

   ``year``
      a numeric vector for the year

   ``country``
      a character vector for the country

   ``y``
      a numeric vector for the outcome.

   ``x1``
      a continuous variable

   ``x2``
      a binary variable

   ``base``
      a numeric vector for the baseline starting point for each country

   ``growth_units``
      a numeric vector for the growth units for each country

   ``growth_error``
      a numeric vector for the growth errors for each country

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   ``x1`` is generated by a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and a
   standard deviation of 2. ``x2`` is drawn from a Bernoulli
   distribution with a probability of .5 of observing a 1.
