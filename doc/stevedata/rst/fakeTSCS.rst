      .. rubric:: Fake Data for a Time-Series Cross-Section
         :name: fake-data-for-a-time-series-cross-section

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This is a toy (i.e. "fake") data set created by the ``fabricatr``
      package. There are 100 observations for 25 hypothetical countries.
      The outcome ``y`` is a linear function of a baseline for each
      hypothetical country, plus a yearly growth trend as well as
      varying growth errors for each country. ``x1`` is supposed to have
      a linear effect of .5 on ``y``, all things considered. ``x2`` is
      supposed to have a linear effect of 1 on ``y`` for each unit
      change in ``x2``, all things considered.

      A data frame with 2500 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``year``
         a numeric vector for the year

      ``country``
         a character vector for the country

      ``y``
         a numeric vector for the outcome.

      ``x1``
         a continuous variable

      ``x2``
         a binary variable

      ``base``
         a numeric vector for the baseline starting point for each
         country

      ``growth_units``
         a numeric vector for the growth units for each country

      ``growth_error``
         a numeric vector for the growth errors for each country

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``x1`` is generated by a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and
      a standard deviation of 2. ``x2`` is drawn from a Bernoulli
      distribution with a probability of .5 of observing a 1.
