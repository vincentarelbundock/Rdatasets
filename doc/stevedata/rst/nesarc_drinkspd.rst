         :name: description

      This toy data set is loosely modified from Wave I of the NESARC
      data set. Here, my main interest is the number of drinks consumed
      on a usual day drinking alcohol in the past 12 months, according
      to respondents in the nationally representative survey of 43,093
      Americans.

      A data frame with 43093 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``idnum``
         a numeric vector and sequence from 1 to the number of rows in
         the data

      ``ethrace2a``
         a numeric vector for the ethnicity/race. 1 = White, not
         Hispanic. 2 = Black, not Hispanic. 3 = AI/AN. 4 = Asian, Native
         Hawaiian, Pacific Islander. 5 = Hispanic or Latino.

      ``region``
         a numeric vector for the Census region. 1 = Northeast. 2 =
         Midwest. 3 = South. 4 = West

      ``age``
         a numeric vector for age in years

      ``sex``
         a numeric vector for sex. 1 = female. 0 = male

      ``marital``
         a numeric vector for marital status. 1 = married. 2 = living
         with someone as married. 3 = widowed. 4 = divorced. 5 =
         separated. 6 = never married

      ``educ``
         a numeric vector for education level, recoded from ``s1q6a`` in
         the original data. 1 = did not make it to/finish high school. 2
         = high school graduate or equivalency. 3 = some college, but no
         four-year degree. 4 = four-year college degree or more.

      ``s2aq8b``
         a numeric vector for the number of drinks of any alcohol
         consumed on days drinking alcohol in the past 12 months. This
         variable is “as-is” from the original data set.

      You will not want to use the ``s2aq8b`` variable without recoding
      it first. Those who cannot recall how much they typically drink
      (i.e. true
      ``⁠don't knows'' or missing info) are coded as 99. Non-drinkers are coded as \code{NA} in the \code{s2aq8b} variable and should be recoded as 0. Any value between 1 and 98 in the variable represents the, for lack of better term, ⁠``\ true”
      number of alcoholic drinks a respondent says s/he typically
      consumes on a day drinking alcohol in the past 12 months, though
      this is evidently preposterous as a count variable. A person
      drinking 42 alcoholic drinks a day would not be alive to tell you
      they did this. The researcher may want to employ some sensible
      right censoring here.
