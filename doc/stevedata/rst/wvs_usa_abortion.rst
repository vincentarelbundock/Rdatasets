      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A data set on attitudes about the justifiability of abortion in
      the United States based on World Values Survey responses recorded
      across six waves (from 1982 to 2011). I assembled this data frame
      probably around 2014 and routinely use it for in-class
      illustration about regression, post-estimation simulation,
      quantities of interest, and how to think about modeling a
      dependent variable that is on a 1-10 scale, but has curious
      heaping patterns.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data come from the World Values Survey. Note that the college
      education variable is curiously ``NA`` until the third survey
      wave. The child autonomy index ranges from -2 to 2 where
      increasing values indicate that children should learn
      determination and independence over obedience and religious faith.
      The ``respectauthority`` variable is coded where -1 means the
      respondent believes greater respect for authority in the United
      States as a future change to the country would be a bad thing. 0
      means the respondent doesn't mind such a change. 1 = the
      respondent believes it would be a good thing.
