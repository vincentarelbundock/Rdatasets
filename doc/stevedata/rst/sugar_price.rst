         :name: imf-primary-commodity-price-data-for-sugar

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This is primary commodity price data for sugar globally, in the
      United States, and in Europe for every month from 1980 to
      (roughly) the present. Prices are nominal U.S. cents per pound and
      are not seasonally adjusted ("NSA").

      A data frame with 1,316 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``date``
         a date

      ``category``
         the category (either the U.S., global, or Europe)

      ``value``
         the price of sugar in U.S. cents per pound (NSA, nominal)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The price data for Europe do not appear to be updated as regularly
      as the global and U.S. prices. Thus, the last month in the data
      for Europe are June 2017. For that reason, I elected to make a
      data set of these data for posterity's sake.
