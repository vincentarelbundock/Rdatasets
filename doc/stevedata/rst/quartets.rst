      .. rubric:: Anscombe's (1973) Quartets
         :name: anscombes-1973-quartets

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These are four x-y data sets, combined into a long format, which
      have the same traditional statistical properties (mean, variance,
      correlation, regression line, etc.). However, they look quite
      different.

      A data frame with 44 observations on the following 3 variables.

         a categorical identifier for the quartet

      ``x``
         a continuous variable

      ``y``

      .. rubric:: Details

      Data come default in R, but I elected to change the format to be a
      bit more accessible.
