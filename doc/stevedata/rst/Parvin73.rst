      A data frame with 26 observations on the following 9 variables.

      ``country``
         a character vector for a country name

      ``levviol``
         a numeric vector for the level of violence

      ``pci``
         a numeric vector for per capita income

      ``incdist``
         a numeric vector for income distribution

      ``d_pci``
         a numeric vector for per capita income growth

      ``sem``
         a numeric vector for socioeconomic mobility

      ``comint``
         a numeric vector for communication intensity

      ``concfac``
         a numeric vector for concentration factor

      ``pop``
         a numeric vector for population size

      The bulk of these data come from Russett's (1964) *World Handbook
      of Political and Social Indicators*. The data themselves are
      transcribed from the appendix of the article, which allows a
      replication of the results that Parvin (1973) reports. You should
      read that article for more information as to what's happening and
      for what purpose.

      I did not catch Parvin (1973) mentioning this in the article, but
      there must be some kind of additive constant in the level of
      violence variable because the logarithmic transformations he
      reports would be undefined for the observations (like Denmark)
      where the level of violence is zero. The easiest way to
      approximate whatever Parvin (1973) did is to add .001 to the level
      of violence variable before taking its logarithmic transformation.
      That would allow a near perfect replication of Table 1.

      It should go without saying that the population reported for
      Belgium, in the appendix, is likely a transcription error.
      Belgium's population is reported here as 9184, not "91.84.00".

      The United Arab Republic was the short-lived union of Egypt and
      Syria, if you were curious what that is in the data.
