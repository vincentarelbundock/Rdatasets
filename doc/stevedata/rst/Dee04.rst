Are There Civics Returns to Education?
--------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This should be a data set for a (partial?) replication of Dee's (2004)
article on the purported civics returns to education. I use these data
for in-class illustration about instrumental variable analyses.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   Dee04

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 9227 observations on the following 8 variables.

``schoolid``
   a numeric vector that should be understood as categorical

``hispanic``
   a numeric vector for if the person is Hispanic

``college``
   a numeric vector for if the person went to college

``black``
   a numeric vector for if the person is black

``otherrace``
   a numeric vector for if the person is another race

``female``
   a numeric vector for if the person is a woman

``register``
   a numeric vector for if the person is registered to vote

``distance``
   a numeric vector for the distance to college

Details
~~~~~~~

I should note I acquired this data set in Mexico City sitting on a
two-week program at IPSA-FLACSO Mexico Summer School in 2019. The sample
size here (9,227) is about two thousand short of what Dee reports in his
article. It'll do, though.
