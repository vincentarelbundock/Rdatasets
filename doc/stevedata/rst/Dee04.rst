   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   This should be a data set for a (partial?) replication of Dee's
   (2004) article on the purported civics returns to education. I use
   these data for in-class illustration about instrumental variable
   analyses.

   I should note I acquired this data set in Mexico City sitting on a
   two-week program at IPSA-FLACSO Mexico Summer School in 2019. The
   sample size here (9,227) is about two thousand short of what Dee
   reports in his article. It'll do, though.
