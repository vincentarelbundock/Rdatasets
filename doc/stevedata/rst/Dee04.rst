      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This should be a data set for a (partial?) replication of Dee's
      (2004) article on the purported civics returns to education. I use
      these data for in-class illustration about instrumental variable
      analyses.

      A data frame with 9227 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``schoolid``
         a numeric vector that should be understood as categorical

      ``hispanic``
         a numeric vector for if the person is Hispanic

      ``college``
         a numeric vector for if the person went to college

      ``black``
         a numeric vector for if the person is black

      ``otherrace``
         a numeric vector for if the person is another race

      ``female``
         a numeric vector for if the person is a woman

      ``register``
         a numeric vector for if the person is registered to vote

      ``distance``
         a numeric vector for the distance to college

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      I should note I acquired this data set in Mexico City sitting on a
      two-week program at IPSA-FLACSO Mexico Summer School in 2019. The
      sample size here (9,227) is about two thousand short of what Dee
      reports in his article. It'll do, though.
