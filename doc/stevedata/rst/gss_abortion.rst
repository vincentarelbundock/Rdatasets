      .. rubric:: Abortion Opinions in the General Social Survey
         :name: abortion-opinions-in-the-general-social-survey

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This is a toy data set derived from the General Social Survey that
      I intend to use for several purposes. First, the battery of
      abortion items can serve as toy data to illustrate mixed effects
      modeling as equivalent to a one-parameter (Rasch) model. Second, I
      include some covariates to also do some basic regressions. I think
      abortion opinions are useful learning tools for statistical
      inference for college students. Third, there's a time-series
      component as well for understanding how abortion attitudes have
      changed over time.
