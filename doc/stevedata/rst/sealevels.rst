      .. rubric:: Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880–2015
         :name: global-average-absolute-sea-level-change-18802015

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These data describe how sea level has changed over time, in both
      relative and absolute terms. Absolute sea level change refers to
      the height of the ocean surface regardless of whether nearby land
      is rising or falling.
