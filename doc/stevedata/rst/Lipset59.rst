      A data frame with 48 observations on the following 11 variables.

      ``country``
         a character country for an English country name

      ``cat``
         a category for the country by their region and level of
         democracy

      ``iso3c``
         a three-character ISO code

      ``wbgdp2011est``
         an estimated gross domestic product in 2011 USD

      ``wbpopest``
         an estimated population size

      ``unpop``
         a population size (in thousands)

      ``uninc``
         a national income (in millions)

      ``unincpc``
         a national income per capita

      ``xm_qudsest``
         a "Quick UDS" estimate of democracy on a latent scale (see
         details)

      ``v2x_polyarchy``
         the Varieties of Democracy "polyarchy" estimate (see details)

      ``polity2``
         the ``polity2`` score from the Polity project (see details)

      The three variables with the prefix of ``un`` nominally come from
      the United Nations Statistical Division for 1949/1950, but are
      actually retrieved from Andic and Peacock (1961). Andic and
      Peacock (1961) note you should be skeptical of Soviet-style
      calculations of national income and thus don't include it in the
      data they make available.

      Anything else is explicitly benchmarked to 1950 as a referent
      year. The GDP and population estimates come by way of Anders et
      al. (2020). You can manually create your own GDP per capita
      variable here because the GDP is demarcated in dollars and the
      population size is in units of 1. Take one and divide it over the
      other.

      The democracy variables are all unique in their own way. The
      "Quick UDS" estimates are generated to be latent and, globally,
      have a mean that approximates 0 and a standard deviation that
      approximates 1. In the regression context, that would mean a
      coefficient would communicate something like a magnitude change
      across a standard deviation on the scale. The "polyarchy" estimate
      has a theoretical minimum of 0 and a theoretical maximum of 1. In
      the regression context, that would mean a coefficient communicates
      a min/max effect. The Polity project estimate comes from a usual
      scale of -10 to 10 and a regression coefficient communicates
      something much less exotic. It's a unit change on this scale.

      In all cases, higher values of democracy = more "democraticness",
      for lack of a better term.
