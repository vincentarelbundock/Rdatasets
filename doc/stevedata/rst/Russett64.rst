      The data are scraped from Table 1 and Table 3 of his article, to
      the best of my ability. I was initially hoping this could be a
      problem for ChatGPT and its OCR functionality. However, ChatGPT
      made an absolute mess of Table 1. The bulk of this is hand-coded.
      The data, as of right now, can effectively reproduce what Russett
      (1964) reports in his analyses, but it is not identical.

      You should read the article to see the assorted citations and data
      caveats that Russett (1964) reports. Those are ultimately
      suppressed/ignored here.
