      Data come from the 2000 Current Population Survey by way of the
      Zelig package. Data should not be used for inferential
      applications, only for pedagogical purposes. See the appropriate
      CPS codebook for more information on variable coding (especially
      for income and education). In all likelihood, age is
      right-censored as well.
