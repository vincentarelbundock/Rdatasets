         :name: fake-data-for-a-time-series

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This is a toy (i.e. "fake") data set created by the ``fabricatr``
      package. There are 100 observations. The outcome ``y`` is a linear
      function of ``20 + (.25 * year) + .(25 * x1) + (1 * x2) + e``.
      This clearly implies some autocorrelation in the data. I.e. it's a
      time-series.

      A data frame with 100 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``year``
         the year

      ``y``
         an outcome

      ``x1``
         a continuous variable

      ``x2``
         a binary variable

      ``e``
         randomly generated errors

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Errors are random-normal with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation
      of 1. ``x1`` is generated by a normal distribution with a mean of
      5 and a standard deviation of 2. ``x2`` is drawn from a Bernoulli
      distribution with a probability of .5 of observing a 1.
