      :name: united-kingdom-effective-exchange-rate-index-data-1990-2022

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   This is a (near) daily data set on the effective exchange rate index
   for the United Kingdom's pound sterling from 1990 onward. The data
   are indexed, such that 100 equals the monthly average in January
   2005. This is useful for illustrating devaluations of the pound after
   Black Wednesday, the financial crisis, and, more recently, the UK's
   separation from the European Union.
