         1990-2022
         :name: united-kingdom-effective-exchange-rate-index-data-1990-2022

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This is a (near) daily data set on the effective exchange rate
      index for the United Kingdom's pound sterling from 1990 onward.
      The data are indexed, such that 100 equals the monthly average in
      January 2005. This is useful for illustrating devaluations of the
      pound after Black Wednesday, the financial crisis, and, more
      recently, the UK's separation from the European Union.
