      .. rubric:: LME Aluminum Premiums Data
         :name: lme-aluminum-premiums-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A near daily data set on the price of aluminum premiums (USD/MT)
      for LME in the U.S., Western Europe, East Asia, and Southeast
      Asia. I like these data as illustrative of some of the
      shortsightedness of the aluminum tariffs that Donald Trump
      announced in March 2018. The tariffs had no discernible effect on
      manufacturing employment or earnings, but they created a supply
      shock that made aluminum more expensive.

      LME aluminum premiums (monthly contracts going out to 15 months)
      work alongside LME aluminum contracts to allow market participants
      to hedge the all-in price and physically deliver or receive
      premium aluminum warrants in non-queued LME premium warehouses.
