   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Sunday prices are set for purchase and do not fluctuate. Timmy and
   Tommy do not accept turnips on Sunday either. Daily prices fluctuate
   both at opening on Nook's Cranny and at noon. This amounts to three
   time periods in the data. "5:00 a.m." is reserved only for Sunday
   purchases (i.e. when Daisy Mae arrives on the island). 8:00 a.m. is
   the morning price because that is when Nook's Cranny opens. 12:00
   p.m. is when the price changes for the day.

   Explanations for missing dates: Timmy and Tommy were renovating the
   shop on May 6, 2021. My wife was diagnosed with cancer and my mother
   in law went to the hospital on the afternoon of Dec. 27, 2021. I did
   not get to play the game on Jan. 9, 2022 because of errands I was
   running for my wife. I plain forgot to check on Feb. 7, 2022.
