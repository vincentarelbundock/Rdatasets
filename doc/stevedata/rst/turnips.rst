      A data frame with the following 3 variables.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Sunday prices are set for purchase and do not fluctuate. Timmy and
      Tommy do not accept turnips on Sunday either. Daily prices
      fluctuate both at opening on Nook's Cranny and at noon. This
      amounts to three time periods in the data. "5:00 a.m." is reserved
      only for Sunday purchases (i.e. when Daisy Mae arrives on the
      island). 8:00 a.m. is the morning price because that is when
      Nook's Cranny opens. 12:00 p.m. is when the price changes for the
      day.

      Explanations for missing dates: Timmy and Tommy were renovating
      the shop on May 6, 2021. My wife was diagnosed with cancer and my
      mother in law went to the hospital on the afternoon of Dec. 27,
      2021. I did not get to play the game on Jan. 9, 2022 because of
      errands I was running for my wife. I plain forgot to check on Feb.
      7, 2022.
