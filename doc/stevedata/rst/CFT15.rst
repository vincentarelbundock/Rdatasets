      This is the replication data for "Randomization Inference in the
      Regression Discontinuity Design: An Application to Party
      Advantages in the U.S. Senate", published in 2015 in *Journal of
      Causal Inference*. I use these data to teach about regression
      discontinuity designs.

      A data frame with 1390 observations on the following 9 variables.

      ``state``
         a numeric vector for the state. This is ultimately a
         categorical variable.

      ``year``
         a numeric vector for the year of the election.

      ``vote``
         a numeric vector for the Democratic vote share in the *next*
         election (i.e. six years later).

      ``margin``
         a numeric vector for the Democratic party's margin of victory
         in the statewide election. This is the running variable, in RDD
         parlance.

      ``class``
         a numeric vector for the class to which each Senate seat
         belongs.

      ``termshouse``
         a numeric vector for the Democratic candidate's cumulative
         number of terms previously served in the U.S. House.

      ``termssenate``
         a numeric vector for the Democratic candidate's cumulative
         number of terms previously served in the U.S. Senate.

      ``population``
         a numeric vector for the population of the Senate seat's state.

      ``treatment``
         a numeric vector that is 1 if ``margin`` > 0 and is 0 if
         ``margin`` < 0.
