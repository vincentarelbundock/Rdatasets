      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Observations taken from the combined seven waves of survey data
      made available by the World Values Survey, but isolated to just
      the United States. The World Values Survey unfortunately did not
      collect information about the education-level of the respondent in
      the 1981 and 1990 waves. These education categories feature in the
      Miller and Davis (2020) article in *Journal of Ethnicity, and
      Politics*, albeit before the release of the seventh wave.
