      Data are spotty and regrettably this is not a perfect time-series.
      However, it is useful for an in-class exercise to show that the
      proliferation of household computers (over time) in the United
      States comes in part because of globalization. Use it for that
      purpose. The data are reasonably faithful, but don't treat it as
      gospel. Exact sourcing available upon request.
