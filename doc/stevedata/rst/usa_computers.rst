   Data are spotty and regrettably this is not a perfect time-series.
   However, it is useful for an in-class exercise to show that the
   proliferation of household computers (over time) in the United States
   comes in part because of globalization. Use it for that purpose. The
   data are reasonably faithful, but don't treat it as gospel. Exact
   sourcing available upon request.
