      A data frame with 24 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``year``
         the year

      ``car``
         the car type, either the Hyundai Excel, Yugo, or Toyota Tercel

      ``sales``
         the number of units sold in the United States

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data come from a website then known as ``carsalesbase.com``. I'm
      aware the inclusion of the Tercel is questionable since the third
      generation of Tercels were quite different from the first and
      second generations. However, I use these data to illustrate how
      poorly the Yugo fared against competing models, including the
      first and second generation Tercels. I think the inclusion is fair
      for that purpose.
