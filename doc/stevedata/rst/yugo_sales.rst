   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 24 observations on the following 3 variables.

   ``year``
      the year

   ``car``
      the car type, either the Hyundai Excel, Yugo, or Toyota Tercel

   ``sales``
      the number of units sold in the United States

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Data come from https://carsalesbase.com. I'm aware the inclusion of
   the Tercel is questionable since the third generation of Tercels were
   quite different from the first and second generations. However, I use
   these data to illustrate how poorly the Yugo fared against competing
   models, including the first and second generation Tercels. I think
   the inclusion is fair for that purpose.
