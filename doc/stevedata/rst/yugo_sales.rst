Yugo Sales in the United States, 1985-1992
------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A data set on Yugo sales against two competing models in the United
States from 1985 to 1992.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   yugo_sales

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 24 observations on the following 3 variables.

``year``
   the year

``car``
   the car type, either the Hyundai Excel, Yugo, or Toyota Tercel

``sales``
   the number of units sold in the United States

Details
~~~~~~~

Data come from https://carsalesbase.com. I'm aware the inclusion of the
Tercel is questionable since the third generation of Tercels were quite
different from the first and second generations. However, I use these
data to illustrate how poorly the Yugo fared against competing models,
including the first and second generation Tercels. I think the inclusion
is fair for that purpose.
