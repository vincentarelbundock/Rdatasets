      A data frame with 125 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``poll_date``
         the effective "date" of the public opinion poll

      ``date``
         a date for the poll, to make for easier plotting

      ``govt_sat``
         the percentage of respondents saying they were satisfied with
         the government

      ``govt_dis``
         the percentage of respondents saying they were dissatisfied
         with the government

      ``thatcher_sat``
         the percentage of respondents saying they were satisfied with
         Margaret Thatcher

      ``thatcher_dis``
         the percentage of respondents saying they were dissatisfied
         with Margaret Thatcher

      ``opp_sat``
         the percentage of respondents saying they were satisfied with
         the leader of the opposition

      ``opp_dis``
         the percentage of respondents saying they were dissatisfied
         with the leader of the opposition

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data come from Ipsos. "Leader of the opposition" was typically
      named in the exact poll. In the lifetime of this series, the
      leader of the opposition was James Callaghan until Nov. 10 1980.
      Thereafter, it was Michael Foot until Oct. 2 1983. Neil Kinnock
      replaces him for the duration of this series. Interpret "leader of
      the opposition" with that in mind.

      The date variable is, again, for simple convenience to make for
      easier plotting. In the absence of a specific day provided by
      Ipsos, the poll benchmarks to the first of the month. In the case
      of a known period of days, it benchmarks to the first day
      provided.
