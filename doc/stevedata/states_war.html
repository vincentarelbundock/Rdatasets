<h2>State Performance in Inter-State Wars</h2>

<p>A data set on state performance in inter-state wars. This data is useful for
evaluating Valentino et al.'s (2010) &quot;Bear Any Burden&quot; analysis using more
current data.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Start date and end date are in &quot;MM/D(D)/YYYY&quot; format. You can extract this
information into multiple columns with a <code>separate</code> function from the
<span class="pkg">tidyr</span> package. This is mostly for convenience. Be mindful of two things:
First, dates are dates of first and last action, and not necessarily the
escalation to war, per se. Second, dates can be &quot;missing&quot;. These are -9s, and
are commonplace when archival research can't pinpoint an exact day something
happened.
</p>
<p>Observations select at the <em>confrontation</em>-level where maximum fatalities are
greater than 1,000 and at the <em>participant</em>-level where (1) the participant
engaged in at least an attack during this confrontation, (2) there are no
instances where a participant dropped in/out on the same side of a
multilateral confrontation or switched sides, and (3) the confrontation
doesn't have an instance where a participant incurred fatalities while
themselves not initiating a use of force. For illustration's sake, the
Taiwan Straits Crises saw several appearances by the United States, but only
one instance (for six days in Feb. 1953) where the U.S. engaged in an attack.
World War II is a classic case of participants switching sides (France did
so three times), but it also happened in the War of Latvian Independence as
well (MIC#2604). The War of Attrition also saw the Russians reappear twice.
Cases like these aren't included, mostly for convenience sake. In total, 41
cases with 1,000 maximum fatalities or more at the confrontation-level are
excluded because of this. Of these 41 cases, World War II and the Vietnam
War are the most conspicuous by their absence. Data come from version 1.01 of
the Militarized Interstate Confrontation data.
</p>
<p>Opponent fatalities are strictly dyadic and are derived from the Militarized
Interstate Events data.
</p>
<p>Capabilities, GDP, and democracy data come from <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> for a
forthcoming v. 1.2.0 release. See package for more information, though
references are also included below. Variables are mostly lagged to the year
prior to the participant observation year. However, there are several cases
in the data that are born into war (see: India, Pakistan, North and South
Korea, North and South Vietnam). In cases of missing data, information from
the observation year is used.
</p>
<p>The <code>tpop</code> and <code>wbpopest</code> columns are measuring the same thing but
are derived from two different data sets with two different data-generating
procedures. Use whichever one you like, but be mindful of what you're doing
and for what purpose you're doing it.
