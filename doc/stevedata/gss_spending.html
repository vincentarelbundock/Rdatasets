<h2>Attitudes Toward National Spending in the General Social Survey (2018)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a toy data set that collects attitudes on toward national spending for
various things in the General Social Survey for 2018. I use these data for
in-class illustration about ordinal variables and ordinal models.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>gss_spending
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2348 observations on the following 33 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>year</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric constant for the GSS survey year (2018)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>id</code></dt><dd><p>a unique identifier for the survey respondent</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>age</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the age of the respondent (min: 18, max: 89)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sex</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the respondent's sex (1 = female, 0 = male)</p>
</dd>

</dd>
<dt><code>degree</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the respondent's highest degree (0 = did not graduate high school, 1 = high school, 2 = junior college, 3 = bachelor degree, 4 = graduate degree)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>race</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the respondent's race (1 = white, 2 = black, 3 = other)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>rincom16</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the respondent's yearly income (min: 1 (under $1,000), max: 26 ($170,000 or over))</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>partyid</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the respondent's party identification on the familiar seven-point scale. NOTE: D to R partisanship in this variable goes from 0 to 6. 7 = supporters of other parties. You may want to recode this if you want an interval-level measure of partisanship.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>polviews</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the respondent's ideology (min: 1 (extremely liberal), max: 7 (extremely conservative))</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>xnorcsiz</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the NORC size code. This is a measure of what kind of area in which the respondent took the survey (i.e. lives). 1 = city, greater than 250k residents. 2 = city, between 50k-250k residents. 3 = suburbs of a large city. 4 = suburbs of a medium-sized city. 5 = unincorporated area of a large city. 6 = unincorporated area of a medium city. 7 = city, between 10-50k residents. 8 = town, greater than 2,500 residents. 9 = smaller areas. 10 = open country.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>news</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for how often the respondent reads the newspapers. 1 = everyday. 2 = a few times a week. 3 = once a week. 4 = less than once a week. 5 = never.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>wrkstat</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the respondent's work status. 1 = working full-time. 2 = working part-time. 3 = temporarily not working. 4 = unemployed/laid off. 5 = retired. 6 = in school. 7 = house-keeping work. 8 = other.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natspac</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on the space program. See details below for this variable and all other variables beginning with <code>nat</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natenvir</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on improving/protecting the environment.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natheal</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on improving/protecting the nation's health.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natcity</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on solving the big city's problems.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natcrime</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on halting the &quot;rising crime rate.&quot; This question is subtly hilarious.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natdrug</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on dealing with drug addiction.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nateduc</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on improving the nation's education system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natrace</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on improving the condition of black people.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natarms</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on the military/armaments/defense.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nataid</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on foreign aid.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natfare</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on welfare.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natroad</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on highways and bridges.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natsoc</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on social security.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natmass</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on mass transportation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natpark</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on parks and recreation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natchld</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on assistance for child care.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natsci</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on scientific research.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>natenrgy</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for attitudes toward spending on alternative sources of energy.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sumnat</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the sum total of responses to all the aforementioned spending variables (i.e. those that begin with <code>nat</code>). This creates an interval-ish measure with a nice and mostly normal distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sumnatsoc</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the sum of all responses toward various &quot;social&quot; prompts (i.e. <code>natenvir</code>, <code>natheal</code>, <code>natdrug</code>, <code>nateduc</code>, <code>natrace</code>, <code>natfare</code>, <code>natroad</code>, <code>natmass</code>, <code>natpark</code>,  <code>natsoc</code>, <code>natchld</code>). This creates an interval-ish measure with a mostly normal (but small left skew) distribution.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For all the variables beginning with <code>nat</code>, note that I rescaled the original data so that -1 = respondent thinks country is spending too much on this topic, 0 = respondent thinks country is spending &quot;about (the) right&quot; amount, and 1 = respondent thinks country is spending too little on this topic. I do this to facilitate reading each <code>nat</code> prompt as increasing support for more spending (the extent to which increasing values means the respondent thinks the country spends too little on a given prompt). I think this is more intuitive.
</p>
<p>Also, the <code>natspac</code>, <code>natenvir</code>, <code>natheal</code>, <code>natcity</code>, <code>natcrime</code>, <code>natdrug</code>, <code>nateduc</code>, <code>natrace</code>, <code>natarms</code>, <code>nataid</code>, and <code>natfare</code> have &quot;alternate&quot; prompts in later GSS waves in which a subset of respondents get a slightly different prompt. For example, one set of respondents for <code>natcity</code> gets a prompt of &quot;Solving the problems of the big cities&quot; (the legacy prompt) whereas another set of respondents gets a prompt of &quot;Assistance to big cities&quot; (typically noted as &quot;version y&quot; in the GSS). I, perhaps problematically if I were interested in publishing analyses on these data, combine both prompts into a single variable. I don't think it's a huge problem for what I want the data to do, but FYI.
