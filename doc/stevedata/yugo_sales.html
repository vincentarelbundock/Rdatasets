<h2>Yugo Sales in the United States, 1985-1992</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set on Yugo sales against two competing models in the United States
from 1985 to 1992.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
yugo_sales
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 24 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>year</code></dt><dd><p>the year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>car</code></dt><dd><p>the car type, either the Hyundai Excel, Yugo, or Toyota Tercel</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sales</code></dt><dd><p>the number of units sold in the United States</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data come from <a href="https://carsalesbase.com">https://carsalesbase.com</a>. I'm aware the inclusion of the
Tercel is questionable since the third generation of Tercels were quite different
from the first and second generations. However, I use these data to illustrate
how poorly the Yugo fared against competing models, including the first and
second generation Tercels. I think the inclusion is fair for that purpose.
