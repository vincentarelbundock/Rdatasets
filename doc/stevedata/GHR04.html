<h2>Comparative Public Health: The Political Economy of Human Misery and Well-Being</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a data set for replicating Ghobarah et al. (2004), a reduced form of
what they make available on Dataverse for replication. Variables have been
renamed for legibility.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>GHR04
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 182 observations on the following 15 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>country</code></dt><dd><p>a character vector denoting a country name</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>iso3c</code></dt><dd><p>a three-character ISO code for the country</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pubhlthexppgdp</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for public health expenditures as a percentage of GDP</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>totexphlth</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for total expenditures on health</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>hale</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for health adjusted life expectancy (in years)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>log_gdppc</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for (log-transformed) GDP per capita</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gini</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for income inequality</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>log_educ</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for (log-transformed) educational attainment</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>log_vanhanen</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for (log-transformed) racial-linguistic-religious heterogeneity</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>rivalry</code></dt><dd><p>a dummy variable indicating the presence of an enduring international rivalry for the country</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>polity</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector communicating a Polity score, as a measure of the democratic nature of the country's regime</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>prvhlthexpgdp</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for private spending on health as a percentage of GDP</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>urban_growth</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for the pace of urbanization</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cwdeaths</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector for civil war deaths</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>contig_cw</code></dt><dd><p>a dummy variable communicating whether there is a civil war in a geographically contiguous territory</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The three-character ISO code is the only new addition to the data. I
add this because the country names they have in the data are not neat and may
lead users astray if they wanted to search for a specific observation. The
ISO code for Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) around this time was &quot;SCG&quot;.
</p>
<p>The data the authors make available come with no .do file to indicate what
exactly they used. Some forensic work based on the descriptive statistics they
mention led to this reduced form of their data, which almost perfectly replicates
their results. The differences are typically in the hundredths, and often in
the thousandths, and should be considered &quot;good enough&quot; for replication
purposes. The only real confusion on my end is why I ended up with one more
observation than they report in their analyses. This suggests one (or more?)
of their variables they use has an <code>NA</code>, but I have no way of knowing what it
could be.
