<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Matching is done on Correlates of War state codes. Thus, the exact
&quot;population&quot; is an amalgam of U.S. aid and Correlates of War state system
membership. Regions are offered, as is, from USAID Data Services.
</p>
<p>Data on aid are &quot;obligations&quot; and not &quot;disbursements&quot;, and thus may better
reflect donor intent. These come from US Overseas Loans &amp; Grants
(&quot;Greenbook&quot;) and were prepared by USAID Data Services on July 14, 2021.
</p>
<p>Greenbook only offers information about dollar amounts of aid, contingent on
receiving aid. Observations were added, based on Correlates of War state system
membership, about countries that could've received aid but did not. Countries
that never received aid at all had to have regions assigned to them ex post.
I don't think the regions imputed for these observations are problematic.
This concerns Andorra, Czechoslovakia, Dominica, German Democratic Republic,
German Federal Republic, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Nauru, Republic
of Vietnam, San Marino, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, Switzerland, Tuvalu,
Yemen Arab Republic, Yemen People's Republic, and Zanzibar.
</p>
<p>Higher values of the physical violence index and civil liberties index
communicate better human rights records. Data are lagged a year.
</p>
<p>Foreign policy similarity is Cohen's (1960) kappa based on valued United
Nations General Assembly voting. Data come from Haege (2011) by way of
<span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>'s <code>add_fpsim()</code> function. Please read
<span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> documentation for more information about these measures,
along with what you should cite for any serious use of these data.
</p>
<p>Minimum distance is calculated using the Vincenty method (&quot;as the crow
flies&quot;). Measurement is in kilometers and data come from <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
and its <code>add_minimum_distance()</code> function. Check package documentation
for appropriate citation for any serious use.
</p>
<p>Estimates of gross domestic product (&quot;GDP&quot;) and population come by way of
<span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> and its <code>add_sdp_gdp()</code> function. Check package
documentation for appropriate citations for any serious use. GDP is in
actual dollars.
</p>
<p>Trade data come from Correlates of War trade data by way of <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span>
and its <code>add_cow_trade()</code> function. Check package documentation for
appropriate citations for any serious use.
</p>
<p>Military expenditure and capabilities data come from Correlates of War by way
of <span class="pkg">peacesciencer</span> and its <code>add_cow_trade()</code> function. Check package
documentation for  appropriate citations for any serious use.
