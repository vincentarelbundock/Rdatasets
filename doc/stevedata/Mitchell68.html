<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are gathered from Table 1 in the document. You should also
read the article for more information as to what's happening and for what
purpose.  Mitchell (1968) is quite clear about where else he's getting these
data. Much of what follows can be discerned in the first few pages of Mitchell
(1968), which jumps right into a conversation about research design after
a brief introduction.
</p>
<p>Province names are taken &quot;as is&quot; from Mitchell (1968). Since South Vietnam
no longer exists, and these observations are about 60 years old, some of
these province names may no longer exist. You may have to search for some
old provincial maps of the former Republic of Vietnam in order to understand
where some of these provinces are/were (especially if you're interested in
the regional variation noted by Paige (1970)).
</p>
<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em> maps inform the government control variable, and there
are assumptions that Mitchell makes about the nature of control by the
government (South Vietnam), the Vietcong, or the areas that are contested.
The &quot;control&quot; here ultimately refers to South Vietnam.
</p>
<p>The observations for government control variable are from 1965. Mitchell's
footnote in his Table 1 says all other variables (except for population
density) correspond with information from 1960. The population density
estimate comes from 1964.
</p>
<p>The coefficient of variation variable is defined as the standard deviation
of land-holding size divided over the mean. If every landholding is of equal
size, the observation is 0. Larger values suggest more variability in
size of land-holdings with the implication being larger land-holdings are
conspicuous in the province. It's a crude, but interesting, measure of
inequality with that in mind.
</p>
<p>The owner-operated land variable is another crude, but interesting/novel
measure. An obvious percentage, 100 implies complete land ownership. 0 implies
universal tenancy where peasants work on land they do not own. Some
familiarity with the peculiarities of South Vietnamese society at the time is
strongly suggested.
</p>
<p>The &quot;French land&quot; and &quot;Vietnamese land&quot; variables refer to a specific agrarian
reform measure (&quot;Ordinance 57&quot;). The Vietnam version includes both expropriated
and redistributed land. The French version includes just expropriated land,
per Mitchell. The logic is the Vietnamese version suggests higher values =
lower inequality since the measure (partly) includes redistributed land. The
French land, being just expropriation, has a single owner (the South
Vietnamese government). That suggests higher inequality for higher values.
This logic is interesting but questionable, and we'll just have to roll with
the premise for the nature of the intended use of these data (i.e.
replication). Paige's (1970) objection is more about regional variation in
South Vietnam and its varied patterns of land use, and not about the
particulars of these two measure (per se).
</p>
<p>The mobility measure is a percentage, referring to the percentage of the
province that is composed of plains and hills without dense forest.
</p>
<p>The data are faithfully (to my level best!) scraped from Table 1 of his
article. However, the results that come from a linear model do not perfectly
reproduce his results (Equation 2, p. 432). I don't know why this is the case,
nor is it that important. It is worth noting that this kind of &quot;step-wise&quot;
procedure he employs for selecting a linear model is 100% not how you should
do it, and that 33rd footnote he includes on p. 432 would be an automatic
rejection at any quantitatively-oriented journal today.
</p>
<p>It may interest the user to see re-analyses of Mitchell (1968) from around
this time. I include those in the references for your consideration. Briefly,
Paige's (1970) objection is that Mitchell (1968) includes radically different
land-holding types into assorted measures of inequality and that Mitchell is
selecting on 1965 (a watershed moment of insurgency during the war).
Paranzino's (1972) critique is primarily statistical, though incorporates
some of the issues raised by Paige (1970). Importantly, he correctly notes
what the results of the linear model should be (p. 567).
