<h2>
Channing House Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>ChanningHouse</code> data frame has 457 rows and 5 columns. This is 5 fewer
than the parent channing data frame in the boot package. These 5 were
removed because the exit time was not smaller than the entry time.
</p>
<p>Channing House is a retirement centre in Palo Alto, California. These data were collected between the opening of the house in 1964 until July 1, 1975. In that time 97 men and 365 women passed through the centre. For each of these, their age on entry and also on leaving or death was recorded. A large number of the observations were censored mainly due to the resident being alive on July 1, 1975 when the data was collected. Over the time of the study 130 women and 46 men died at Channing House. Differences between the survival of the sexes, taking age into account, was one of the primary concerns of this study.
