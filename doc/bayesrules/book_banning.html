<h2>Book Banning Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The book banning data was collected by Fast and Hegland as part of a course project
at St Olaf College, and distributed with &quot;Broadening Your Statistical Horizons&quot; by Legler and Roback.
This data set includes the features and outcomes for 931 book challenges 
(ie. requests to ban a book) made in the US between 2000 and 2010.
Information on the books being challenged and the characteristics of these books 
were collected from the American Library Society. State-level demographic information and 
political leanings were obtained from the US Census Bureau and Cook Political Report, respectively.
Due to an outlying large number of challenges, book challenges made in the state of Texas 
were omitted.
