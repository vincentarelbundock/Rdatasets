      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data are from a clinical trial of patients with respiratory
      illness, where 111 patients from two different clinics were
      randomized to receive either placebo or an active treatment.
      Patients were examined at baseline and at four visits during
      treatment. The respiratory status (categorized as 1 = good, 0 =
      poor) was determined at each visit.
