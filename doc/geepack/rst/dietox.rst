      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Weight
         Weight in Kg

      Feed
         Cumulated feed intake in Kg

      Time
         Time (in weeks) in the experiment

      Pig
         Factor; id of each pig

      Evit
         Factor; vitamin E dose; see 'details'.

      Cu
         Factor, copper dose; see 'details'

      Start
         Start weight in experiment, i.e. weight at week 1.

      Litter
         Factor, id of litter of each pig

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data contains weight of slaughter pigs measured weekly for 12
      weeks. Data also contains the startweight (i.e. the weight at week
      1). The treatments are 3 different levels of Evit = vitamin E
      (dose: 0, 100, 200 mg dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetat /kg feed) in
      combination with 3 different levels of Cu=copper (dose: 0, 35, 175
      mg/kg feed) in the feed. The cumulated feed intake is also
      recorded. The pigs are littermates.
