         Factor Study.

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data are from the Muscatine Coronary Risk Factor (MCRF) study,
      a longitudinal survey of school-age children in Muscatine, Iowa.
      The MCRF study had the goal of examining the development and
      persistence of risk factors for coronary disease in children. In
      the MCRF study, weight and height measurements of five cohorts of
      children, initially aged 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, and 13-15 years,
      were obtained biennially from 1977 to 1981. Data were collected on
      4856 boys and girls. On the basis of a comparison of their weight
      to age-gender specific norms, children were classified as obese or
      not obese.
