      .. rubric:: Log-size of 79 Sitka spruce trees
         :name: log-size-of-79-sitka-spruce-trees

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``spruce`` data frame has 1027 rows and 6 columns. The data
      consists of measurements on 79 sitka spruce trees over two growing
      seasons. The trees were grown in four controlled environment
      chambers, of which the first two, containing 27 trees each, were
      treated with introduced ozone at 70 ppb whilst the remaining two,
      containing 12 and 13 trees, were controls.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      chamber
         a numeric vector of chamber numbers

      ozone
         a factor with levels ``enriched`` and ``normal``

      id
         a numeric vector of tree id

      time
         a numeric vector of the time when the measurements were taken,
         measured in days since Jan. 1, 1988

      wave
         a numeric vector of the measurement number

      logsize
         a numeric vector of the log-size
