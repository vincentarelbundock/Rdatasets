         :name: description

      A data frame of 2279 patients transplanted at the EBMT between
      1985 and 1998. These data were used in Fiocco, Putter & van
      Houwelingen (2008), van Houwelingen & Putter (2008, 2012) and de
      Wreede, Fiocco & Putter (2011). The included variables are

      id
         Patient identification number

      rec
         Time in days from transplantation to recovery or last follow-up

      rec.s
         Recovery status; 1 = recovery, 0 = censored

      ae
         Time in days from transplantation to adverse event (AE) or last
         follow-up

      ae.s
         Adverse event status; 1 = adverse event, 0 = censored

      recae
         Time in days from transplantation to both recovery and AE or
         last follow-up

      recae.s
         Recovery and AE status; 1 = both recovery and AE, 0 = no
         recovery or no AE or censored

      rel
         Time in days from transplantation to relapse or last follow-up

      rel.s
         Relapse status; 1 = relapse, 0 = censored

      srv
         Time in days from transplantation to death or last follow-up

      srv.s
         Relapse status; 1 = dead, 0 = censored

      year
         Year of transplantation; factor with levels "1985-1989",
         "1990-1994", "1995-1998"

      agecl
         Patient age at transplant; factor with levels "<=20", "20-40",
         ">40"

      proph
         Prophylaxis; factor with levels "no", "yes"

      match
         Donor-recipient gender match; factor with levels "no gender
         mismatch", "gender mismatch"
