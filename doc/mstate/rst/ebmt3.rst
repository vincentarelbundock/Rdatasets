      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A data frame of 2204 patients transplanted at the EBMT between
      1995 and 1998. These data were used in Section 4 of the tutorial
      on competing risks and multi-state models (Putter, Fiocco &
      Geskus, 2007). The included variables are

      id
         Patient identification number

      prtime
         Time in days from transplantation to platelet recovery or last
         follow-up

      prstat
         Platelet recovery status; 1 = platelet recovery, 0 = censored

      rfstime
         Time in days from transplantation to relapse or death or last
         follow-up (relapse-free survival time)

      rfsstat
         Relapse-free survival status; 1 = relapsed or dead, 0 =
         censored

      dissub
         Disease subclassification; factor with levels "AML", "ALL",
         "CML"

      age
         Patient age at transplant; factor with levels "<=20", "20-40",
         ">40"

      drmatch
         Donor-recipient gender match; factor with levels "No gender
         mismatch", "Gender mismatch"

      tcd
         T-cell depletion; factor with levels "No TCD", "TCD"
