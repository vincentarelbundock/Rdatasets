         infection and AIDS

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These data sets give the times (in years) from HIV infection to
      AIDS, SI switch and death in 329 men who have sex with men (MSM).
      Data are from the period until combination anti-retroviral therapy
      became available (1996). For more background information on the
      cohort, ccr5 and SI, see Geskus *et al.* (2000, 2003)

      ``aidssi`` contains follow-up data until the first of AIDS and SI
      switch. It was used as example for the competing risks analyses in
      Putter, Fiocco, Geskus (2007) and in Geskus (2016).

      ``aidssi2`` extends the ``aidssi`` data set in three ways. First,
      it considers events after the initial one. Second, it includes the
      entry times of the individuals that entered the study after HIV
      infection. Third, age at HIV infection has been added as extra
      covariable. Numbers differ slightly from the ``aidssi`` data set.
      Some individuals were diagnosed with AIDS only when they died and
      others had their last follow-up at AIDS diagnosis. In order to
      prevent two transitions to happen at the same time, their time to
      AIDS was shortened by 0.25 years. This data set was used as
      example for the multi-state analyses in Geskus (2016).
