      Eligible subjects were adults, who spoke Spanish or English,
      reported alcohol, heroin or cocaine as their first or second drug
      of choice, resided in proximity to the primary care clinic to
      which they would be referred or were homeless. Patients with
      established primary care relationships they planned to continue,
      significant dementia, specific plans to leave the Boston area that
      would prevent research participation, failure to provide contact
      information for tracking purposes, or pregnancy were excluded.

      Subjects were interviewed at baseline during their detoxification
      stay and follow-up interviews were undertaken every 6 months for 2
      years. A variety of continuous, count, discrete, and survival time
      predictors and outcomes were collected at each of these five
      occasions.

      This dataset is a superset of the HELPmiss and HELPrct datasets
      which include far fewer variables. Full details of the survey
      instruments are available at the following link.
