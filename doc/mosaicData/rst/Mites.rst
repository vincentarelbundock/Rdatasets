      Data from an experiment to test whether exposure to mites protects
      against Wilt Disease in cotton plants.

      A data frame with 47 observations on the following variables.

      ``treatment``
         a factor with levels ``mites`` and ``no mites``

      ``outcome``
         a factor with levels ``wilt`` and ``no wilt``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Researchers suspected that attack of a plant by one organism
      induced resistance to subsequent attack by a different organism.
      Individually potted cotton plants were randomly allocated to two
      groups: infestation by spider mites or no infestation. After two
      weeks the mites were dutifully removed by a conscientious research
      assistant, and both groups were inoculated with Verticillium, a
      fungus that causes Wilt disease. More information can be found at
      https://www.causeweb.org/cause/webinar/activity/2010-01/.
