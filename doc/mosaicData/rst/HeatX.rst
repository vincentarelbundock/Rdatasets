      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These data were collected by engineering students at Calvin
      College. The apparatus consists of concentric pipes insulated from
      the environment so that as nearly as can be managed the only heat
      exchange is between the hot and cold water.

         data(HeatX)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 6 observations on the following variables.

      ``trial``
         trial number

      ``T.cold.in``
         temperature (C) of the cold water as it enters the apparatus

      ``T.cold.out``
         temperature (C) of the cold water as it leaves the apparatus

      ``m.cold``
         flow rate (L/min) of the cold water

      ``T.hot.in``
         temperature (C) of the hot water as it enters the apparatus

      ``T.hot.out``
         temperature (C) of the hot water as it leaves the apparatus

      ``m.hot``
         flow rate (L/min) of the hot water
