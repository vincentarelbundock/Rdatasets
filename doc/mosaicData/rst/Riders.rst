      .. rubric:: Volume of Users of a Massachusetts Rail Trail
         :name: volume-of-users-of-a-massachusetts-rail-trail

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data north
      of Chestnut Street in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5,
      2005 to November 15, 2005. Data collectors set up a laser sensor,
      with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user
      passed the data collection station.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 90 observations on the following 12 variables.

      ``date``
         date of data collection (POSIXct)

      ``day``
         a factor with levels ``Monday``, ``Tuesday``, ``Wednesday``,
         ``Thursday``, ``Friday``, ``Saturday``, and ``Sunday``.

      ``highT``
         high temperature for the day (in degrees Fahrenheit)

      ``lowT``
         low temperature for the day (in degrees Fahrenheit)

      ``hi``
         shorter name for ``highT``

      ``lo``
         shorter name for ``lowT``

      ``precip``
         inches of precipitation

      ``clouds``
         measure of cloud cover (in oktas)

      ``riders``
         estimated number of trail crossings that day (number of breaks
         recorded)

      ``ct``
         shorter name for ``riders``

      ``weekday``
         type of day: a factor with levels ``N`` (weekend or holiday)
         ``Y`` (non-holiday weekday)

      ``wday``
         shorter name for ``weekday``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      There is a potential for error when two users trigger the infrared
      beam at exactly the same time since the counter would only logs
      one of the crossings. The collectors left the motion detector out
      during the winter, but because the counter drops data when the
      temperature falls below 14 degrees Fahrenheit, there are no data
      for the coldest winter months.
