         :name: description

      The HELP study was a clinical trial for adult inpatients recruited
      from a detoxification unit. Patients with no primary care
      physician were randomized to receive a multidisciplinary
      assessment and a brief motivational intervention or usual care,
      with the goal of linking them to primary medical care.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Eligible subjects were adults, who spoke Spanish or English,
      reported alcohol, heroin or cocaine as their first or second drug
      of choice, resided in proximity to the primary care clinic to
      which they would be referred or were homeless. Patients with
      established primary care relationships they planned to continue,
      significant dementia, specific plans to leave the Boston area that
      would prevent research participation, failure to provide contact
      information for tracking purposes, or pregnancy were excluded.

      Subjects were interviewed at baseline during their detoxification
      stay and follow-up interviews were undertaken every 6 months for 2
      years. A variety of continuous, count, discrete, and survival time
      predictors and outcomes were collected at each of these five
      occasions.

      This data set is a subset of the ``HELPmiss`` data set restricted
      to the 453 subjects who were fully observed on the ``age``,
      ``cesd``, ``d1``, ``female``, ``sex``, ``g1b``, ``homeless``,
      ``i1``, ``i2``, ``indtot``, ``mcs``, ``pcs``, ``pss_fr``,
      ``racegrp``, ``satreat``, ``substance``, ``treat``, and
      ``sexrisk`` variables. (There is some missingness in the other
      variables.) ``HELPmiss`` contains 17 additional subjects with
      partially observed data on some of these baseline variables. This
      is also a subset of the ``HELPfull`` data which includes 5
      timepoints and many additional variables.
