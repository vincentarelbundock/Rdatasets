Quoted from the source: "From a very young age, shoes for boys tend to
be wider than shoes for girls. Is this because boys have wider feet, or
because it is assumed that girls, even in elementary school, are willing
to sacrifice comfort for fashion? To assess the former, a statistician
measures kids' feet."
