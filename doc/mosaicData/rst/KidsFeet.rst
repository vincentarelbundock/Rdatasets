      Quoted from the source: "From a very young age, shoes for boys
      tend to be wider than shoes for girls. Is this because boys have
      wider feet, or because it is assumed that girls, even in
      elementary school, are willing to sacrifice comfort for fashion?
      To assess the former, a statistician measures kids' feet."
