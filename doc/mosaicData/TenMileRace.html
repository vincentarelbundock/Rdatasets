<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run is a road race held in Washington,

<ul>
<li><p><code>state</code> State of residence of runner.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>net</code> The recorded time (in seconds) from when the runner crossed the starting
line to when the runner crossed the finish line.  This is generally

gone off.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>sex</code> A factor with levels <code>F</code> <code>M</code>.

  gf_point(net ~ age | sex, data = TenMileRace, color = ~sex, alpha = 0.1) %&gt;%
