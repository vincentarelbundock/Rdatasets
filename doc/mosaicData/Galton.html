<h2>Galton's dataset of parent and child heights</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In the 1880's, Francis Galton was developing ways to quantify the
heritability of traits.  As part of this work, he collected data on
the heights of adult children and their parents.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data(Galton)
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 898 observations on the following variables.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>family</code> a factor with levels for each family
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>father</code> the father's height (in inches)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>mother</code> the mother's height (in inches)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>sex</code> the child's sex: <code>F</code> or <code>M</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>height</code> the child's height as an adult (in inches)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>nkids</code> the number of adult children in the family, or, at least,
the number whose heights Galton recorded.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Entries were deleted for
those children whose heights were not recorded numerically by Galton,
who sometimes used entries such as &quot;tall&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;idiotic&quot;,
&quot;deformed&quot; and so on.
