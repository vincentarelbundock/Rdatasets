         :name: description

      Simulated economic time series representing GDP, Import, Export
      and Balance of Trade (BOT) of Samplonia. Samplonia is a fictional
      Island invented by Jelke Bethelehem (2009). The country has 10 000
      inhabitants. It consists of two provinces: Agria and Induston.
      Agria is a rural province consisting of the mostly fruit and
      vegetable producing district of Wheaton and the mostly cattle
      producing Greenham. Induston has four districts. Two districts
      with heavy industry named Smokeley and Mudwater. Newbay is a
      young, developing district while Crowdon is where the rich
      Samplonians retire. The current data set contains several time
      series from Samplonia's national accounts system in long format.

      There are annual and quarterly time series on GDP, Import, Export
      and Balance of Trade, for Samplonia as a whole, for each province
      and each district. BOT is defined as Export-Import for each region
      and period; quarterly figures are expected to add up to annual
      figures for each region and measure, and subregions are expected
      to add up to their super-regions.
