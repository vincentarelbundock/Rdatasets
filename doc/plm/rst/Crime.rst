      *total number of observations* : 630

      *observation* : regional

      *country* : United States

      The variables l\* (lcrmrte, lprbarr, ...) contain the pre-computed
      logarithms of the base variables as found in the original data
      set. Note that these values slightly differ from what R's log()
      function yields for the base variables. In order to reproduce
      examples from the literature, the pre-computed logs need to be
      used, otherwise the results differ slightly.
