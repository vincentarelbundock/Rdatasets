<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set is from a pharmacokinetic study of oral dosing of the anti-asthma medication, theophylline, in 12 subjects over 25 hours, published By Dr. Robert A. Upton around 1980. The original publication, if any, is unclear and not cited. These data were used in a package named <code>nlme</code>, and reported in Boeckmann, A.J., et al.Dr. Upton did publish several papers on theophylline pharmacokinetics around 1980-1984, and these data could have been from one of these.<br />
Theophylline is an methylxanthine anti-asthma medication, which acts as a bronchodilator, with secondary effects to strengthen diaphragm contraction, reduce pulmonary artery pressures, and reduce mast cell release. It can be administered by the intravenous, oral, or rectal suppository routes.<br />
Each subject in this Study (oral route) received a single oral dose of theophylline.
Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the first 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity of theophylline in the plasma at each time point was measured in micrograms per milliliter. <br />
Unfortunately, the theophylline plasma level in blood varies considerably between patients, because of differences in drug clearance, which is affected by body mass, age, smoking, liver and heart function, and viral infections. To complicate this drug further, it has important interactions with a number of other common medicines which can increase or decrease the drug level. Each subject in this study received a single oral dose of 300 mg of theophylline, which has been converted to a milligrams per kilogram dose. Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the next 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity of theophylline in the plasma at each time point was measured in micrograms per milliliter of plasma. <br />
