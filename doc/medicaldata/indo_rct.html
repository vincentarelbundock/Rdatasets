<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram, is a procedure performed by threading an endoscope through the mouth to the opening in the duodenum where bile and pancreatic digestive juices are released into the intestine. ERCP is helpful for treating blockages of flow of bile (gallstones, cancer), or diagnosing cancers of the pancreas, but has a high rate of complications (15-25%). <br />
The occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is a common and feared complication, as pancreatitis can result in multisystem organ failure and death, and can occur in ~ 16% of ERCP procedures. <br />
The inflammatory cytokine storm that can result from this procedural complication can be quite severe. Several small randomized trials suggested that anti-inflammatory NSAID therapies at the time of ERCP could reduce the rate of this complication, but all were rather small single-center studies, and were not sufficiently convincing to change practice. <br />
Elmunzer, Higgins, and colleagues performed a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375470/">meta-analysis</a> of these small trials, which suggested that this was a significant effect, and that indomethacin could result in a 64% reduction in post-ERCP pancreatitis. <br />
The investigators took this as a possible over-estimate of the effect (due to publication bias), and designed a multicenter RCT of a planned 948 patients to see a reduction of 50% from a placebo rate of 10% to an indomethacin rate of 5%. Two interim analyses were performed, after 400 and 600 patients were enrolled, using an alpha spending function. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board stopped the study after 602 participants were enrolled because of the significantly positive effect of indomethacin, which reduced post-ERCP pancreatitis from 16% in the placebo group to 9% in the indomethacin group. <br />
