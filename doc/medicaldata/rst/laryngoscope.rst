      | This data set contains 99 adult patients with a body mass index
        between 30 and 50 kg/m2 who required orotracheal intubation for
        elective surgery. Patient demographics, airway assessment data,
        intubation success rate, time to intubation, ease of intubation,
        and occurrence of complications were recorded. The dataset is
        cleaned and complete. There are no outliers or data problems
        (**more details** available below the variable definitions).

      | The Laryngoscope dataset was contributed by Dr. Amy Nowacki,
        Associate Professor, Cleveland Clinic. Please refer to this
        resource as: Amy S. Nowacki, 'Laryngoscope Dataset', TSHS
        Resources Portal (2017). Available at

      | Difficult and failed tracheal intubations are among the
        principal causes of anesthetic-related mortality and morbidity.
        Because a good laryngeal view facilitates successful tracheal
        intubation, new technologies have been introduced to improve
        visualization. Video laryngoscopes, for example, often use
        miniature cameras to facilitate visualization of the laryngeal
        inlet with no need to align the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal
        axes.
      | The Pentax AWS is a novel video laryngoscope, available in Japan
        since 2006, which is designed to facilitate intubation by
        providing a video image of the glottis. It incorporates a
        miniature video camera and a battery-powered, built-in LCD
        monitor. A disposable blade is attached to the base system.
        Incorporation of an LCD display makes it possible to view the
        glottis simultaneously with insertion of the endotracheal tube
        (ETT). In this regard, it differs from some other video
        laryngoscope designs that use external monitors. The Pentax AWS
        also differs in having a side channel that positions and guides
        the ETT. Reports suggest that the Pentax AWS can help intubate,
        but randomized data remain sparse.cr This study tested the
        hypothesis that intubation with the Pentax AWS would be easier
        and faster than with a standard Macintosh laryngoscope with a #4
        blade.
