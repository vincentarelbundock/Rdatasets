      | This data set contains 103 patients who were scheduled to
        undergo an upper extremity procedure suitable for
        supraclavicular anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to
        either (1) combined group-ropivacaine and mepivacaine mixture;
        or (2) sequential group-mepivacaine followed by ropivacaine. A
        number of demographic and post-op pain medication variables
        (fentanyl, alfentanil, midazolam) were collected. The primary
        outcome is time to 4-nerve sensory block onset. The dataset is
        cleaned and relatively complete. There are no outliers or data
        problems (**more details** available below the variable
        definitions).

      | The choice of anesthetic technique combined with a suitable plan
        for postoperative analgesia can facilitate early discharge,
        improve patient comfort, and increase overall satisfaction.
        Patients having painful procedures who undergo general
        anesthesia have a 2- to 5-fold greater risk of unplanned
        overnight admissions compared with those having regional
        anesthesia. Regional anesthetic techniques and peripheral nerve
        blocks are especially favored for surgeries on the extremities.
        Both rapid onset of the block and prolonged postoperative
        analgesia are desired characteristics of regional anesthesia.
      | The choice of local anesthetics or combinations thereof can
        greatly influence the effectiveness of the block, onset time,
        duration of postoperative analgesia, need for opioid use, and
        patient satisfaction. Mepivacaine and ropivacaine are commonly
        used in peripheral nerve blocks, their drawbacks being a short
        duration with 1.5% mepivacaine and a delayed onset with 0.5%
        ropivacaine. An ideal local anesthetic with high potency, low
        toxicity, rapid onset, and prolonged duration does not exist
        yet. Investigators have therefore tried mixtures of local
        anesthetics in an attempt to combine their advantages with
        conflicting results. A potential problem is that mixing drugs
        dilutes the effects of each. Thus, a mixture of a rapid-onset
        drug such as mepivacaine with a long-acting one such as
        ropivacaine may well result in slower onset than mepivacaine
        alone and shorter duration of action than ropivacaine alone. In
        contrast, sequential administration of the same amounts of the
        same drugs may preserve the desirable features of each.
      | Objective: This study investigates whether sequential
        supraclavicular injection of 1.5% mepivacaine followed 90
        seconds later by 0.5% ropivacaine provides a quicker onset and a
        longer duration of analgesia than an equidose combination of the
        2 local anesthetics.
