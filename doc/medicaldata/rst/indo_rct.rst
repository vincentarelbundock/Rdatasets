      | ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram, is a
        procedure performed by threading an endoscope through the mouth
        to the opening in the duodenum where bile and pancreatic
        digestive juices are released into the intestine. ERCP is
        helpful for treating blockages of flow of bile (gallstones,
        cancer), or diagnosing cancers of the pancreas, but has a high
        rate of complications (15-25%).
      | The occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is a common and feared
        complication, as pancreatitis can result in multisystem organ
        failure and death, and can occur in ~ 16% of ERCP procedures.
      | The inflammatory cytokine storm that can result from this
        procedural complication can be quite severe. Several small
        randomized trials suggested that anti-inflammatory NSAID
        therapies at the time of ERCP could reduce the rate of this
        complication, but all were rather small single-center studies,
        and were not sufficiently convincing to change practice.
      | Elmunzer, Higgins, and colleagues performed a
        `meta-analysis <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375470/>`__ of
        these small trials, which suggested that this was a significant
        effect, and that indomethacin could result in a 64% reduction in
        post-ERCP pancreatitis.
      | The investigators took this as a possible over-estimate of the
        effect (due to publication bias), and designed a multicenter RCT
        of a planned 948 patients to see a reduction of 50% from a
        placebo rate of 10% to an indomethacin rate of 5%. Two interim
        analyses were performed, after 400 and 600 patients were
        enrolled, using an alpha spending function. The Data and Safety
        Monitoring Board stopped the study after 602 participants were
        enrolled because of the significantly positive effect of
        indomethacin, which reduced post-ERCP pancreatitis from 16% in
        the placebo group to 9% in the indomethacin group.
