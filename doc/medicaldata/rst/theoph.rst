      | This data set is from a pharmacokinetic study of oral dosing of
        the anti-asthma medication, theophylline, in 12 subjects over 25
        hours, published By Dr. Robert A. Upton around 1980. The
        original publication, if any, is unclear and not cited. These
        data were used in a package named ``nlme``, and reported in
        Boeckmann, A.J., et al.Dr. Upton did publish several papers on
        theophylline pharmacokinetics around 1980-1984, and these data
        could have been from one of these.
      | Theophylline is an methylxanthine anti-asthma medication, which
        acts as a bronchodilator, with secondary effects to strengthen
        diaphragm contraction, reduce pulmonary artery pressures, and
        reduce mast cell release. It can be administered by the
        intravenous, oral, or rectal suppository routes.
      | Each subject in this Study (oral route) received a single oral
        dose of theophylline. Blood samples were taken at frequent
        intervals over the first 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity
        of theophylline in the plasma at each time point was measured in
        micrograms per milliliter.
      | Unfortunately, the theophylline plasma level in blood varies
        considerably between patients, because of differences in drug
        clearance, which is affected by body mass, age, smoking, liver
        and heart function, and viral infections. To complicate this
        drug further, it has important interactions with a number of
        other common medicines which can increase or decrease the drug
        level. Each subject in this study received a single oral dose of
        300 mg of theophylline, which has been converted to a milligrams
        per kilogram dose. Blood samples were taken at frequent
        intervals over the next 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity
        of theophylline in the plasma at each time point was measured in
        micrograms per milliliter of plasma.
