      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from a case-control study of esophageal cancer in
      Ille-et-Vilaine, France, evaluating the effects of smoking and
      alcohol on the incidence of esophageal cancer. Smoking and alcohol
      are associated risk factors for squamous cell cancer of the
      esophagus, rather than adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which is
      associated with obesity and esophageal reflux (more details
      available below the variable definitions).

      An original base R dataset, though of somewhat unclear origin. The
      statistical textbook source is clear, though it is not clear which
      of the original epidemiological papers on esophageal cancer in
      Ille-et-Vilaine is referred to by this dataset. The original
      authors of the medical study were **not** credited in the base R
      dataset. There are several possible papers in PubMed, none of
      which quite match up with this dataset. This could be from Tuyns,
      AJ, et al., Bull Cancer, 1977;64(1):45-60, but this paper reports
      778 controls, rather than the 975 found here. A 1975 paper from
      the same group reported 718 cases (Int J Epidemiol, 1975
      Mar;4(1):55-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/4.1.55.). There is also another
      possible source - a 1975 paper from the same group, *Usefulness of
      population controls in retrospective studies of alcohol
      consumption. Experience from a caseâ€“control study of esophageal
      cancer in Ille-et-Vilaine, France*, Journal of Studies on Alcohol,
      39(1): 175-182 (1978), which is behind a publisher paywall.
