         :name: description

      | This data set contains 64 consecutive patients who underwent
        T-cell replete, matched sibling donor reduced-intensity
        conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The
        primary risk factor of interest was the number of activating
        killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (aKIRs: 1-4 vs. 5-6). (more
        details after variable information).

         :name: details

      | A number of demographic, baseline and transplant characteristics
        were also collected. The primary outcome is presence of and time
        to cytomegalovirus reactivation. The dataset is cleaned and
        relatively complete. There are no outliers or data problems.

      .. rubric:: Background
         :name: background

      | Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the
        transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, from
        bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It is a
        medical procedure most often performed for patients with certain
        cancers of the blood or bone marrow, such as multiple myeloma or
        leukemia. Allogeneic HSCT involves two people: the (healthy)
        donor and the (patient) recipient. Allogeneic HSC donors must
        have a tissue (HLA) type that matches the recipient.
      | In myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, chemotherapy or irradiation is
        given immediately prior to a transplant (the conditioning
        regimen) with the purpose of eradicating the patient's disease
        prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions.
        The bone marrow can be ablated (destroyed) with dose- levels
        that cause minimal injury to other tissues. For many patients
        who are at high risk for transplant-related mortality with
        myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, reduced- intensity conditioning
        allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant has proven
        effective. Although the reduced-intensity conditioning
        allogeneic HSCT may avoid many of the organ toxicities
        associated with myeloablative conditioning, the risk for
        developing graft-versus-host disease and infection including
        cytomegalovirus remains significant.
      | Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost
        anyone. Once infected, your body retains the virus for life.
        Most people don't know they have CMV because it rarely causes
        problems in healthy people. But if pregnant or having a weakened
        immune system, CMV is cause for concern. For people with
        compromised immunity, such as after allogeneic HSCT, CMV
        infection can be fatal. Natural killer (NK) and T cells provide
        protection against CMV reactivation. The reactivity of NK cells
        and some T-cell subsets are regulated by the interaction of
        killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) with target cell HLA
        class 1 molecules. The donor activating KIR genotype has been
        implicated as a contributing factor for CMV reactivation after
        myeloablative allogeneic HSCT.

      .. rubric:: Study Objective
         :name: study-objective

      | This study investigates whether donor KIR genotype influences
        reactivation of CMV after T-cell replete, matched sibling donor
        reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HSCT.

      .. rubric:: Subjects and Variables
         :name: subjects-and-variables

      | The study included 64 consecutive patients who underwent T-cell
        replete, matched sibling donor reduced-intensity conditioning
        allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant between January
        16, 2000 and April 24, 2007 at the Cleveland Clinic. Human
        leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing on donors and recipients was
        performed to allow assessment of killer immunoglobulin-like
        receptor ligands (KIRs). To allow for comparison with previous
        studies, donors were categorized as having 1-4 or 5-6 activating
        killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genes (aKIRs).
      | CMV reactivation was defined as any detection of cytomegalovirus
        DNA in the blood; the lower detection limit for this assay was
        600 copies/mL.
      | The initial population consisted of 865 men who had undergone
        radical prostatectomy and received transfusion during or within
        30 days of the surgical procedure at Cleveland Clinic and had
        available PSA follow-up data. Of these patients, 110 were
        excluded from the analysis because they received a combination
        of allogeneic and autologous blood products. Of the remaining
        755 patients, 405 (54%) received solely allogeneic and 350
        patients (46%) received solely autologous RBC units. Of the 405
        patients who received allogeneic RBC transfusion, 89 were
        excluded because their transfused RBC age distribution included
        more than one of the terciles. Thus, this dataset consists of
        the 316 patients who received solely allogeneic blood products
        and could be classified into an RBC age exposure group.
