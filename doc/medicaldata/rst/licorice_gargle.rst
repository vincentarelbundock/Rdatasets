      | This study enrolled 236 adult patients undergoing elective
        thoracic surgery requiring a double-lumen endotracheal tube.
        Gender, physical status, BMI, age, Mallampati score, smoking
        status, preoperative pain, surgery size, intervention and the
        outcomes (cough, sore throat and pain swallowing at various time
        points) are provided. The dataset is cleaned and complete
        (missing outcomes for 2 patients). There are no outliers or data
        problems (**more details** available below the variable

      | Postoperative sore throat is a common and annoying complication
        of endotracheal intubation. Intubation with double-lumen tubes,
        which are much larger than conventional single-lumen tubes, are
        especially likely to provoke sore throats, with a reported
        incidence up to 90%. Presumably, postoperative sore throats are
        a consequence of local tissue trauma, due to laryngoscopy and/or
        endotracheal intubation, leading to inflammation of pharyngeal
        mucosa.
      | Nonpharmacological methods for preventing an intubation-related
        sore throat include using smaller-sized endotracheal tubes,
        lubricating the endotracheal tube with water-soluble jelly, and
        careful airway instrumentation as examples. Pharmacological
        measures for attenuating postoperative sore throats include
        inhalation of beclomethasone or fluticasone propionate; gargling
        with azulene sulfonate, aspirin, or ketamine; and gargling or
        spraying benzydamine hydrochloride on the endotracheal cuff for
        example. Each of these approaches and others not listed,
        however, has limitations and variable success rates; thus none
        has become established or is in routine clinical use.
      | Recently, a study reported that gargling with licorice halves
        the risk of sore throat after intubation with conventional
        endotracheal tubes, based on a study of just 40 patients. A
        number of active ingredients have been isolated from licorice,
        including glycyrrhizin, liquilitin, liquiritigenin, and
        glabridin. The glycyrrhizin component reportedly has
        anti-inflammatory and antiallergic properties. Liquilitin and
        liquiritigenin have peripheral and central antitussive
        properties. Glabridin has significant antioxidant and
        ulcer-healing properties, which might help heal pharyngeal and
        tracheal mucosa after minor injuries that often complicate
        laryngoscopy, intubation, and endotracheal tube cuff inflation.
      | This study tested the hypothesis that gargling with licorice
        solution immediately before induction of anesthesia prevents
        sore throat and postextubation coughing in patients intubated
        with double-lumen tubes.
