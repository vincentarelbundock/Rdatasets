      | The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to
        determine whether treatment of maternal periodontal disease can
        reduce risk of preterm birth and low birth weight (**more
        details** available below the variable definitions).

      | Randomized Clinical Trial on the Effect of Treatment of Maternal
        Periodontal Disease Can Reduce Preterm Birth Risk.
      | Maternal periodontal disease has been linked in observational
        studies to preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and low birth weight (<
        2500 g) outcomes. The Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy study
        was a multi-center randomized trial evaluating the effect of
        nonsurgical periodontal treatment intervention on preterm birth,
        comparing outcomes of women treated before 21 weeks gestation
        (treatment) to those treated after delivery (control).
      | Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation,
        is a growing problem. In some cases, preterm birth can lead to
        infant death; in others, its consequences may include
        neurodevelopmental disabilities, cognitive impairment, and/or
        respiratory disorders in the child. Many risk factors for
        preterm birth have already been identified, including maternal
        age, drug use, and diabetes. However, such factors are exhibited
        in only about half of preterm birth mothers, highlighting a need
        to expand our understanding of what contributes to preterm birth
        risk.
      | Several observational studies have suggested an association
        between maternal periodontal disease and preterm birth.
        Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition characterized
        by the destruction of tissue and/or bone around the teeth. A
        major component of periodontal disease is oral colonization by
        gram-negative bacteria; systemic release of cytokines and/or
        lipopolysaccharides from these bacteria may impact fetal
        condition.
      | Inoculation of the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis into
        pregnant animals does have a dose-dependent effect on birth
        weight and preterm birth signaling, but no such causal link has
        been shown in humans, only some associations. Though not
        definitive, the possibility of a significant relationship raises
        the question of whether treatment of maternal periodontal
        disease can decrease preterm birth risk.

      .. rubric:: Participants:
         :name: participants

      | 823 participants enrolled at 4 centers underwent stratified
        randomization, resulting in 413 women assigned to the treatment
        group and 410 to control. All participants were 13-16 weeks
        pregnant at time of randomization (baseline/visit 1) and went on
        to attend monthly follow-up visits defined as visits 2, 3, 4,
        and 5 corresponding to gestational age ranges of 17-20, 21-24,
        25-28, and 29-32 weeks.

      .. rubric:: Treatment:
         :name: treatment

      | The treatment group received periodontal treatment, oral hygiene
        instruction, and tooth polishing at their follow-ups, while
        those assigned to control underwent only brief oral exams. Data
        collection occurred at visits 1 (baseline), 3, and 5. The
        primary outcome of interest is gestational age at end of
        pregnancy. Additional outcomes include birthweight, clinical
        measures of periodontal disease, and various microbiological and
        immunological outcomes.

      .. rubric:: Analysis:
         :name: analysis

      | Statistical analyses were carried out on an intent-to-treat
        basis. Gestational age can be thought of as 'time until end of
        pregnancy,' for which certain survival analysis methods would be
        appropriate. The study used a log-rank test stratified by center
        to compare time until end of pregnancy for treatment and control
        groups.
      | A semiparametric proportional hazards model was also used for
        this purpose and incorporated maternal risk factors as
        predictors. For the study's main analyses, gestational age was
        censored at 37 weeks (259 days) because the interest was in
        extending pregnancies that would otherwise end pre-term, not
        extending pregnancies generally.
      | Though not used in the study itself, logistic regression is
        another method that could be applied: for example, to
        gestational age, dichotomized as 'preterm' or 'not preterm'
        according to a gestational age cutoff, or to birthweight
        dichotomized as 'low' or 'high' at the 2500 g or other cutoff
        (2500 g would be in keeping with the World Health Organization's
        definition for low birth weight). Changes in clinical measures
        of periodontal disease from baseline to visits 3 or 5 could be
        analyzed using mixed effects linear models. The dataset also
        features a number of baseline characteristics, which could be
        compared in treatment and control groups via Student t-tests,
        Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Fisher's exact tests or Pearson's
        chi-square tests, as appropriate.

        periodontal treatment and preterm birth risk. The results of
        this study were published in 2006 by Michalowicz et al.,
