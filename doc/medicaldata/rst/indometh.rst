      | This data set contains data on 6 healthy volunteer subjects who
        participated in a pharmacokinetic study of intravenous
        indomethacin. Indomethacin is an anti-inflammatory and
        pain-relieving non-steroidal medication. It can be administered
        by the intravenous, oral, or rectal suppository routes. Some of
        the indomethacin is excreted in the bile and reabsorbed by the
        intestine. This phenomenon, called enterohepatic circulation,
        keeps the drug around longer than would be expected otherwise.
      | Each subject in Study 1 (intravenous route) received a single 50
        mg dose of radioactively labeled indomethacin
        (^14^-carbon-labeled, with each dose containing 25 microCuries
        of radioactivity). Subjects received a standard meal (one 8-oz
        can of Metrecal, 8 oz of whole milk, and one medium-size apple)
        30 rain prior to medication and 8 oz of water every 2 hr
        throughout the waking hours to ensure adequate urine output.
      | Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the first 8
        hours after dosing, and the quantity of indomethacin in the
        plasma (as well as stool and urine) at each time point was
        measured in micrograms per milliliter. This data set only
        contains the plasma measurements from Table 1 on page 258 of the
        manuscript. While this paper was published in 1976
        (post-Tuskegee reveal), there is no mention of ethics review,
        IRB review, or consent of the healthy volunteers.
      | The abstract from the original manuscript:
      | There are no discernible quantitative differences in the
        biotransformation and the excretion of indomethacin following
        oral, rectal, and intravenous administration of
        indomethacin-2-^14^C. Approximately 50% (range 24-115% for n =
        6) of an intravenous dose undergoes enterohepatic circulation.
        Thus the bioavailability of indomethacin to the systemic
        circulation may exceed the administered dose. Relative to the
        intravenous dose, indomethacin is 80 and 100% bioavailable from
        suppositories and capsules, respectively. Absorption and/or
        reabsorption appears to be more rapid and uniform by the rectal
        route. Recognition of the attributes of biliary recycling also
        helps to explain the observed variability in apparent plasma
        half-life, while their neglect requires alternative explanations
        for anomalies between the disappearance rate from plasma and the
        corresponding appearance rate in urine.
