   | This data set contains data on 6 healthy volunteer subjects who
     participated in a pharmacokinetic study of intravenous
     indomethacin. Indomethacin is an anti-inflammatory and
     pain-relieving non-steroidal medication. It can be administered by
     the intravenous, oral, or rectal suppository routes. Some of the
     indomethacin is excreted in the bile and reabsorbed by the
     intestine. This phenomenon, called enterohepatic circulation, keeps
     the drug around longer than would be expected otherwise.
   | Each subject in Study 1 (intravenous route) received a single 50 mg
     dose of radioactively labeled indomethacin (^14^-carbon-labeled,
     with each dose containing 25 microCuries of radioactivity).
     Subjects received a standard meal (one 8-oz can of Metrecal, 8 oz
     of whole milk, and one medium-size apple) 30 rain prior to
     medication and 8 oz of water every 2 hr throughout the waking hours
     to ensure adequate urine output.
   | Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the first 8
     hours after dosing, and the quantity of indomethacin in the plasma
     (as well as stool and urine) at each time point was measured in
     micrograms per milliliter. This data set only contains the plasma
     measurements from Table 1 on page 258 of the manuscript. While this
     paper was published in 1976 (post-Tuskegee reveal), there is no
     mention of ethics review, IRB review, or consent of the healthy
     volunteers.
   | The abstract from the original manuscript:
   | There are no discernible quantitative differences in the
     biotransformation and the excretion of indomethacin following oral,
     rectal, and intravenous administration of indomethacin-2-^14^C.
     Approximately 50% (range 24-115% for n = 6) of an intravenous dose
     undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Thus the bioavailability of
     indomethacin to the systemic circulation may exceed the
     administered dose. Relative to the intravenous dose, indomethacin
     is 80 and 100% bioavailable from suppositories and capsules,
     respectively. Absorption and/or reabsorption appears to be more
     rapid and uniform by the rectal route. Recognition of the
     attributes of biliary recycling also helps to explain the observed
     variability in apparent plasma half-life, while their neglect
     requires alternative explanations for anomalies between the
     disappearance rate from plasma and the corresponding appearance
     rate in urine.
