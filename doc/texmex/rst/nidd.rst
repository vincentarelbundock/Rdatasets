      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Rainfall, wave-surge, Port Pirie and River Nidd data sets.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      The format of the rain data is: num [1:17531] 0 2.3 1.3 6.9 4.6 0
      1 1.5 1.8 1.8 ...

      The wave-surge data is bivariate and is used for testing functions
      in ``texmex``.

      The Port Pirie data has two columns: 'Year' and 'SeaLevel'.

      The River Nidd data represents 154 measurements of the level of
      the River Nidd at Hunsingore Weir (Yorkshire, UK) between 1934 and
      1969. Each measurement breaches the threshold of $65 m^3/2$.
      Various authors have analysed this dataset, as described by
      Papastathopoulos and Tawn~egp, there being some apparent
      difficulty in identifying a threshold above which GPD models are
      suitable.

      The rain, wave-surge and Port Pirie datasets are used by Coles and
      appear in the ``ismev`` package. The River Nidd data appear in the
      ``evir`` package.
