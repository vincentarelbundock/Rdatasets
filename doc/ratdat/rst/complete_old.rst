      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data on individual rodents captured at the Portal Project and the
      plots they were captured in. This data.frame is the same as
      'complete', but only containing data from 1977 to 1989. This is so
      that instructors can have learners begin working with a clean,
      older dataset, and later introduce a messy version of the newer
      years of data, in whatever format fits their needs.
