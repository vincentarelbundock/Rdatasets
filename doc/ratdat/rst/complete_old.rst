      :name: complete_old

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Data on individual rodents captured at the Portal Project and the
   plots they were captured in. This data.frame is the same as
   'complete', but only containing data from 1977 to 1989. This is so
   that instructors can have learners begin working with a clean, older
   dataset, and later introduce a messy version of the newer years of
   data, in whatever format fits their needs.
