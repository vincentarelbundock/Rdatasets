      .. rubric:: Shakespeare's Word Type Frequencies
         :name: shakespeares-word-type-frequencies

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data set, from Efron and Thisted (1976), gives the number of
      distinct words types (``Freq``) of words that appeared exactly
      once, twice, etc. up to 100 times (``count``) in the complete
      works of Shakespeare. In these works, Shakespeare used 31,534
      distinct words (types), comprising 884,647 words in total.

      Efron & Thisted used this data to ask the question, "How many
      words did Shakespeare know?" Put another way, suppose another new
      corpus of works Shakespeare were discovered, also with 884,647
      words. How many new word types would appear? The answer to the
      main question involves contemplating an infinite number of such
      new corpora.
