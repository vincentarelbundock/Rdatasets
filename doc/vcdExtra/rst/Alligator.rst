      .. rubric:: Alligator Food Choice
         :name: alligator-food-choice

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The Alligator data, from Agresti (2002), comes from a study of the
      primary food choices of alligators in four Florida lakes.
      Researchers classified the stomach contents of 219 captured
      alligators into five categories: Fish (the most common primary
      food choice), Invertebrate (snails, insects, crayfish, etc.),
      Reptile (turtles, alligators), Bird, and Other (amphibians,
      plants, household pets, stones, and other debris).

         data(Alligator)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame with 80 observations on the following 5
      variables.

      ``lake``
         a factor with levels ``George`` ``Hancock`` ``Oklawaha``
         ``Trafford``

      ``sex``
         a factor with levels ``female`` ``male``

      ``size``
         alligator size, a factor with levels ``large`` (>2.3m)
         ``small`` (<=2.3m)

      ``food``
         primary food choice, a factor with levels ``bird`` ``fish``
         ``invert`` ``other`` ``reptile``

      ``count``
         cell frequency, a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The table contains a fair number of 0 counts.

      ``food`` is the response variable. ``fish`` is the most frequent
      choice, and often taken as a baseline category in multinomial
      response models.
