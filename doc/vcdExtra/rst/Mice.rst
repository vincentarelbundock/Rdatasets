      .. rubric:: Mice Depletion Data
         :name: mice-depletion-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from Kastenbaum and Lamphiear (1959). The table gives the
      number of depletions (deaths) in 657 litters of mice, classified
      by litter size and treatment. This data set has become a classic
      in the analysis of contingency tables, yet unfortunately little
      information on the details of the experiment has been published.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("Mice")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame with 30 observations on the following 4
      variables, representing a 5 x 2 x 3 contingency table.

      ``litter``
         litter size, a numeric vector

      ``treatment``
         treatment, a factor with levels ``A`` ``B``

      ``deaths``
         number of depletions, a factor with levels ``0`` ``1`` ``2+``

      ``Freq``
         cell frequency, a numeric vector
