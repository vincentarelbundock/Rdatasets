         :name: bartlett-data-on-plum-root-cuttings

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      In an experiment to investigate the effect of cutting length (two
      levels) and planting time (two levels) on the survival of plum
      root cuttings, 240 cuttings were planted for each of the 2 x 2
      combinations of these factors, and their survival was later
      recorded.

      Bartlett (1935) used these data to illustrate a method for testing
      for no three-way interaction in a contingency table.

         :name: format

      A 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 3 variables
      for 960 observations. The variable names and their levels are:

      == ========== ===================
      No Name       Levels
      1  ``Alive``  ``"Alive", "Dead"``
      2  ``Time``   ``"Now", "Spring"``
      3  ``Length`` ``"Long", "Short"``
      \
