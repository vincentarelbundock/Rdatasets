      Both table variables can be considered ordinal. The variable
      ``visit`` refers to visiting patterns recorded hospital. The
      category labels are abbreviations of those given by Goodman
      (1983); e.g., ``"Regular"`` is short for “received visitors
      regularly or patient went home”. The variable ``stay`` refers to
      length of stay in hospital, in year groups.
