      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data set is a contingency table of job satisfaction by income
      for a small sample of black males from the 1996 General Social
      Survey, as used by Agresti (2002) for an example.

         data(JobSat)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A 4 x 4 contingency table of ``income`` by ``satisfaction``, with
      the following structure:

      ::

          table [1:4, 1:4] 1 2 1 0 3 3 6 1 10 10 ...
          - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
           ..$ income      : chr [1:4] "< 15k" "15-25k" "25-40k" "> 40k"
           ..$ satisfaction: chr [1:4] "VeryD" "LittleD" "ModerateS" "VeryS"

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Both ``income`` and ``satisfaction`` are ordinal variables, and
      are so ordered in the table. Measures of association,
      visualizations, and models should take ordinality into account.
