      .. rubric:: Hair Color and Eye Color in Caithness and Aberdeen
         :name: hair-color-and-eye-color-in-caithness-and-aberdeen

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A three-way frequency table crossing eye color and hair color in
      two places, Caithness and Aberdeen, Scotland. These data were of
      interest to Fisher (1940) and others because there are mixtures of
      people of Nordic, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon origin.

      One or both tables have been widely analyzed in conjunction with
      RC and canonical correlation models for categorical data, e.g.,
      Becker and Clogg (1989).
