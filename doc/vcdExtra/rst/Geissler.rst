      .. rubric:: Geissler's Data on the Human Sex Ratio
         :name: geisslers-data-on-the-human-sex-ratio

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Geissler (1889) published data on the distributions of boys and
      girls in families in Saxony, collected for the period 1876-1885.
      The ``Geissler`` data tabulates the family composition of 991,958
      families by the number of boys and girls listed in the table
      supplied by Edwards (1958, Table 1).

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(Geissler)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 90 observations on the following 4 variables.
      The rows represent the non-NA entries in Edwards' table.

      ``boys``
         number of boys in the family, ``0:12``

      ``girls``
         number of girls in the family, ``0:12``

      ``size``
         family size: ``boys+girls``

      ``Freq``
         number of families with this sex composition

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data on family composition was available because, on the birth
      of a child, the parents had to state the sex of all their children
      on the birth certificate. These family records are not necessarily
      independent, because a given family may have had several children
      during this 10 year period, included as multiple records.
