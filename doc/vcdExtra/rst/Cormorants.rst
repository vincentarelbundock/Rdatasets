      .. rubric:: Advertising Behavior by Males Cormorants
         :name: advertising-behavior-by-males-cormorants

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Male double-crested cormorants use advertising behavior to attract
      females for breeding. In this study by Meagan McRae (2015),
      cormorants were observed two or three times a week at six stations
      in a tree-nesting colony for an entire season, April 10, 2014-July
      10, 2014. The number of advertising birds was counted and these
      observations were classified by characteristics of the trees and
      nests.

      The goal is to determine how this behavior varies temporally over
      the season and spatially, as well as with characteristics of
      nesting sites.

      ::

         data("Cormorants")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 343 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``category``
         Time of season, divided into 3 categories based on breeding
         chronology, an ordered factor with levels ``Pre`` <
         ``Incubation`` < ``Chicks Present``

      ``week``
         Week of the season

      ``station``
         Station of observations on two different peninsulas in a park,
         a factor with levels ``B1`` ``B2`` ``C1`` ``C2`` ``C3`` ``C4``

      ``nest``
         Type of nest, an ordered factor with levels ``no`` <
         ``partial`` < ``full``

      ``height``
         Relative height of bird in the tree, an ordered factor with
         levels ``low`` < ``mid`` < ``high``

      ``density``
         Number of other nests in the tree, an ordered factor with
         levels ``zero`` < ``few`` < ``moderate`` < ``high``

      ``tree_health``
         Health of the tree the bird is advertising in, a factor with
         levels ``dead`` ``healthy``

      ``count``
         Number of birds advertising, a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Observations were made on only 2 days in weeks 3 and 4, but 3 days
      in all other weeks. One should use log(days) as an offset, so that
      the response measures rate.

      ``Cormorants$days <- ifelse(Cormorants$week %in% 3:4, 2, 3)``
