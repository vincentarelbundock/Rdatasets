         :name: student-opinion-about-the-vietnam-war

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A survey of student opinion on the Vietnam War was taken at the
      University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 1967 and
      published in the student newspaper. Students were asked to fill in
      ballot papers stating which policy out of A,B,C or D they
      supported. Responses were cross-classified by gender/year.

      The response categories were:

      ``A``
         Defeat North Vietnam by widespread bombing and land invasion

      ``B``
         Maintain the present policy

      ``C``
         De-escalate military activity, stop bombing and begin
         negotiations

      ``D``
         Withdraw military forces Immediately

      A frequency data frame with 40 observations representing a 2 x 5 x
      4 contingency table on the following 4 variables.

      ``sex``
         a factor with levels ``Female`` ``Male``

      ``year``
         year of study, an ordered factor with levels ``Freshmen``,
         ``Sophomore``, ``Junior``, ``Senior``, ``Grad student``

      ``response``
         a factor with levels ``A`` ``B`` ``C`` ``D``

      ``Freq``
         cell frequency, a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details

      For some analyses, it is useful to treat ``year`` as numeric, and
      possibly assign grad students a value ``year=7``.
