         :name: tv-viewing-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data set ``TV`` comprises a 5 x 11 x 3 contingency table
      based on audience viewing data from Neilsen Media Research for the
      week starting November 6, 1995.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(TV)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A 5 x 11 x 3 array of cell frequencies with the following
      structure:

      ::

          int [1:5, 1:11, 1:3] 146 244 233 174 294 151 181 161 183 281 ...
          - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 3
           ..$ Day    : chr [1:5] "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" ...
           ..$ Time   : chr [1:11] "8:00" "8:15" "8:30" "8:45" ...
           ..$ Network: chr [1:3] "ABC" "CBS" "NBC"

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The original data, ``tv.dat``, contains two additional networks:
      "Fox" and "Other", with small frequencies. These levels were
      removed in the current version. There is also a fourth factor,
      transition State transition (turn the television Off, Switch
      channels, or Persist in viewing the current channel). The ``TV``
      data here includes only the Persist observations.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      The original data, ``tv.dat``, came from the initial
      implementation of mosaic displays in R by Jay Emerson (1998).
      Similar data had been used by Hartigan and Kleiner (1984) as an
      illustration.
