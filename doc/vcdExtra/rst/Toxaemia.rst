      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Brown et al (1983) gave these data on two signs of toxaemia, an
      abnormal condition during pregnancy characterized by high blood
      pressure (hypertension) and high levels of protein in the urine.
      If untreated, both the mother and baby are at risk of
      complications or death.

      The data frame ``Toxaemia`` represents 13384 expectant mothers in
      Bradford, England in their first pregnancy, who were also
      classified according to social class and the number of cigarettes
      smoked per day.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame in frequency form representing a 5 x 3 x 2 x 2
      contingency table, with 60 observations on the following 5
      variables.

      ``class``
         Social class of mother, a factor with levels ``1`` ``2`` ``3``
         ``4`` ``5``

      ``smoke``
         Cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy, a factor with
         levels ``0`` ``1-19`` ``20+``

      ``hyper``
         Hypertension level, a factor with levels ``Low`` ``High``

      ``urea``
         Protein urea level, a factor with levels ``Low`` ``High``

      ``Freq``
         frequency in each cell, a numeric vector
