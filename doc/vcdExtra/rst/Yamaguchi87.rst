      .. rubric:: Occupational Mobility in Three Countries
         :name: occupational-mobility-in-three-countries

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Yamaguchi (1987) presented this three-way frequency table,
      cross-classifying occupational categories of sons and fathers in
      the United States, United Kingdom and Japan. This data set has
      become a classic for models comparing two-way mobility tables
      across layers corresponding to countries, groups or time (e.g.,
      Goodman and Hout, 1998; Xie, 1992).

      The US data were derived from the 1973 OCG-II survey; those for
      the UK from the 1972 Oxford Social Mobility Survey; those for
      Japan came from the 1975 Social Stratification and Mobility
      survey. They pertain to men aged 20-64.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame with 75 observations on the following 4
      variables. The total sample size is 28887.

      ``Son``
         a factor with levels ``UpNM`` ``LoNM`` ``UpM`` ``LoM`` ``Farm``

      ``Father``
         a factor with levels ``UpNM`` ``LoNM`` ``UpM`` ``LoM`` ``Farm``

      ``Country``
         a factor with levels ``US`` ``UK`` ``Japan``

      ``Freq``
         a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Five status categories â€“ upper and lower nonmanuals (``UpNM``,
      ``LoNM``), upper and lower manuals (``UpM``, ``LoM``), and
      ``Farm``) are used for both fathers' occupations and sons'
      occupations.

      Upper nonmanuals are professionals, managers, and officials; lower
      nonmanuals are proprietors, sales workers, and clerical workers;
      upper manuals are skilled workers; lower manuals are semi-skilled
      and unskilled nonfarm workers; and farm workers are farmers and
      farm laborers.

      Some of the models from Xie (1992), Table 1, are fit in
      ``demo(yamaguchi-xie)``.
