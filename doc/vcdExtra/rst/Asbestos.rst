      .. rubric:: Effect of Exposure to Asbestos
         :name: effect-of-exposure-to-asbestos

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A two-way contingency table formed from the cross-classification
      of the number of years of occupational exposure to asbestos and
      the diagnosed severity of asbestosis of 1117 New York workers.
      Asbestosis is a chronic lung disease that results in the lung
      tissue being scared due to contact with the fibers which can lead
      to severe breathing difficulties.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("Asbestos")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      The format is: num [1:5, 1:4] 310 212 21 25 7 36 158 35 102 35 ...
      - attr(\*, "dimnames")=List of 2 ..$ exposure: chr [1:5] "0-9"
      "10-19" "20-29" "30-39" ... ..$ grade : chr [1:4] "None" "Grade 1"
      "Grade 2" "Grade 3"

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``exposure`` and ``grade`` should be regarded as ordered factors.
      Beh and Lombardo (2022) use this data to illustrate a polynomial
      biplot for ordered categories.

      The data summarized here was studied by Beh and Smith (2011) and
      comes from the original data collected and published by Selikoff
      (1981) who examined the link between asbestos exposure and
      asbestosis severity in 1963.
