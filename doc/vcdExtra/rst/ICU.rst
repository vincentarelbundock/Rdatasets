         :name: icu-data-set

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ICU data set consists of a sample of 200 subjects who were
      part of a much larger study on survival of patients following
      admission to an adult intensive care unit (ICU), derived from
      Hosmer, Lemeshow and Sturdivant (2013) and Friendly (2000).

      The major goal of this study was to develop a logistic regression
      model to predict the probability of survival to hospital discharge
      of these patients and to study the risk factors associated with
      ICU mortality. The clinical details of the study are described in
      Lemeshow, Teres, Avrunin, and Pastides (1988).

      This data set is often used to illustrate model selection methods
      for logistic regression.

         with levels ``>=18`` ``<18``

      ``creatin``
         Creatinine, from initial blood gases, a factor with levels
         ``<=2`` ``>2``

      ``coma``
         Level of unconsciousness at admission to ICU, a factor with
         levels ``None`` ``Stupor`` ``Coma``

      ``white``
         a recoding of ``race``, a factor with levels ``White``
         ``Non-white``

      ``uncons``
         a recoding of ``coma`` a factor with levels ``No`` ``Yes``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Patient ID numbers are the rownames of the data frame.

      Note that the last two variables ``white`` and ``uncons`` are a
      recoding of respectively ``race`` and ``coma`` to binary
      variables.
