      There are a number of related versions of the Titanic data, in
      various formats. This version was derived from ``ptitanic`` in the
      rpart.plot package, modifying it to remove the
      ``Class 'labelled'`` attributes for some variables (inherited from
      Frank Harrell's ``titanic3`` version) which caused problems with
      some applications, notably ``ggplot2``.

      Other versions:

      ``Titanic`` is the 4-way frequency table of all 2201 people aboard
      the Titanic, including passengers and crew.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      The original R source for this dataset was compiled by Frank
      Harrell and Robert Dawson:
      https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic.html,
      described in more detail in
      https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3info.txt

      For this version of the Titanic data, passenger details were
      deleted, survived was cast as a factor, and the name changed to
      ``Titanicp`` to minimize confusion with other versions.
