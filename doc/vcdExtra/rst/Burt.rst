         :name: description

      Cyril Burt (1950) gave these data, on a sample of 100 people from
      Liverpool, to illustrate the application of a method of factor
      analysis (later called multiple correspondence analysis) applied
      to categorical data.

      He presented these data initially in the form that has come to be
      called a "Burt table", giving the univariate and bivariate
      frequencies for an n-way frequency table.

      ::

         data("Burt")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame (representing a 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 frequency
      table) with 36 cells on the following 5 variables.

      ``Hair``
         hair color, a factor with levels ``Fair`` ``Red`` ``Dark``

      ``Eyes``
         eye color, a factor with levels ``Light`` ``Mixed`` ``Dark``

      ``Head``
         head shape, a factor with levels ``Narrow`` ``Wide``

      ``Stature``
         height, a factor with levels ``Tall`` ``Short``

      ``Freq``
         a numeric vector

      Burt says: "In all, 217 individuals were examined, about
      two-thirds of them males. But, partly to simplify the calculations
      and partly because the later observations were rather more
      trustworthy, I shall here restrict my analysis to the data
      obtained from the last hundred males in the series."

      ``Head`` and ``Stature`` reflect a binary coding where people are
      classified according to whether they are below or above the
      average for the population.
