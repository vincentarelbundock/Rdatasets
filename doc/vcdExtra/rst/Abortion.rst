      A 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 3 variables
      for 1100 observations. The variable names and their levels are:

      == ==================== ====================
      No Name                 Levels
      1  ``Sex``              ``"Female", "Male"``
      2  ``Status``           ``"Lo", "Hi"``
      3  ``Support_Abortion`` ``"Yes", "No"``
      \                       
      == ==================== ====================

      ``Support_Abortion`` is a natural response variable.

      The combinations of ``Sex`` and ``Status`` represent four
      independent samples, having fixed ``Sex``-``Status`` marginal
      totals. There were 500 females and 600 males. Within the female
      group, 250 of low status and 250 of high status were sampled.
      Similarly for the males, with 300 in each of the low and high
      status sub-groups.

      This is an example of a product-multinomial sampling scheme. the
      ``Sex:Status`` association must be included in any loglinear model
      where the goal is to determine how attitude toward abortion
      depends on the others.

      Alternatively, a logit model for abortion support may provide a
      simpler analysis.
