      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A data set giving the number of publications by doctoral
      candidates in biochemistry in relation to various predictors,
      originally from Long (1997).

      There is a large number of zero counts. Is there evidence for a
      separate group of non-publishers?

      ``phdprestige``

         prestigious the program.

      In this version of the data set, ``phdprestige`` had been rounded
      to the nearest integer. A Stata version with the continuous values
      was subsequently found at
