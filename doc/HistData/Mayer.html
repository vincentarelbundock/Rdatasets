<h2>
Mayer's Data on the Libration of the Moon.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mayer had twenty-seven days' observations of Manilius and only three unknowns.
The form of Mayer's problem is almost the same as that of Legendre, who
developed later the least squares method.
</p>
<p>&quot;How did Mayer address his overdetermined system of equations? His approach was
a simple and straightforward one, so simple and straightforward that a
twentieth-century reader might arrive at the very mistaken opinion that the
procedure was not remarkable at all. Mayer divided his equations into three
groups of nine equations each, added each of the three groups separately, and
solved the resulting three linear equations for <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>, <code class="reqn">\beta</code> and
<code class="reqn">\alpha sin\theta</code> (and then solved for <code class="reqn">\theta</code>). His choice of which
equations belonged in which groups was based upon the coefficients of
<code class="reqn">\alpha</code> and <code class="reqn">\alpha sin \theta</code>.
The first group consisted of the nine equations with the largest positive
values for the coefficient of a, namely, equations 1,2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11,12,
and 27. The second group were those with the nine largest negative values
for this coefficient: equations 8, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26. The
remaining nine equations formed the third group, which he described as
having the largest values for the coefficient of <code class="reqn">\alpha sin \theta</code>.&quot;

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Stigler (1986):
</p>
<p>&quot;The development of the method of least squares was closely associated with three
of the major scientific problems of the eighteenth century: (1) to determine and
represent mathematically the motions of the moon; (2) to account for an
apparently secular (that is, nonperiodic) inequality that had been observed in
the motions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn; and (3) to determine the shape or
figure of the earth. These problems all involved astronomical observations and
the theory of gravitational attraction, and they all presented intellectual
challenges that engaged the attention of many of the ablest mathematical
scientists of the period.
</p>
<p>Over the period from April 1748 to March 1749, Mayer made numerous observations
of the positions of several prominent lunar features; and in his 1750 memoir he
showed how these data could be used to determine various characteristics of the
moon's orbit. His method of handling the data was novel, and it is well worth
considering this method in detail, both for the light it sheds on his
pioneering, if limited, understanding of the problem and because his approach
was widely circulated in the major contemporary treatise on astronomy, having
signal influence upon later work.&quot;
</p>
<p>His analysis led to this equation:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\beta - (90-h) = \alpha sin(g-k) - \alpha sin\theta cos(g-k)</code>
</p>

<p>According to Stigler (1986, p. 21), this &quot;equation would hold if no errors were
present. The modern tendency would be to write, say&quot;:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">(h - 90) = - \beta + \alpha sin (g - k) - \alpha sin\theta cos(g - k) + E</code>
</p>

<p>treating <code class="reqn">(h - 90)</code> as the dependent variable and  <code class="reqn">-\beta</code>, <code class="reqn">\alpha</code>,
and <code class="reqn">-\alpha sin \theta</code> as the parameters in a linear regression model.
