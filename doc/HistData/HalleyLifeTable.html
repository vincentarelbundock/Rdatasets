<h2>
Halley's Life Table
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In 1693 the famous English astronomer Edmond Halley studied
the birth and death records of the city of Breslau, which
had been transmitted to the Royal Society by Caspar Neumann.
He produced a life table showing the number of people
surviving to any age from a cohort born the same year. He
also used his table to compute the price of life annuities.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("HalleyLifeTable")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 84 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>age</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>deaths</code></dt><dd><p>number of deaths, <code class="reqn">D_k</code>, among people of age k, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>number</code></dt><dd><p>size of the population, <code class="reqn">P_k</code> surviving until this age, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ratio</code></dt><dd><p>the ratio <code class="reqn">P_{k+1}/P_k</code>, the conditional probability
of surviving until age k + 1 given that one had already reached age k, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Halley's table contained only <code>age</code> and <code>number</code>.
For people aged over 84 years, Halley just noted that their total number was 107.
This value is not included in the data set.
</p>
<p>The data from Breslau had a mean of 1,238 births per year: this is the value that
Halley took for the size, <code class="reqn">P_0</code> of the population cohort at age 0. 
From the data, he could compute the annual mean
<code class="reqn">D_k</code> of the number of deaths among people aged <code class="reqn">k</code> for all <code class="reqn">k &gt;= 0</code>.
From this, he calculated the number <code class="reqn">P_{k+1}</code> surviving one more year,
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">P_{k+1} = P_k - D_k</code>
</p>

<p>This method had the great advantage of not requiring a general census but only knowledge of the
number of births and deaths and of the age at which people died during a few years.
