      .. rubric:: Daily Deaths from Cholera and Diarrhaea in England,
         1849
         :name: daily-deaths-from-cholera-and-diarrhaea-in-england-1849

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Deaths from Cholera and Diarrhaea, for each day of the month of
      each of the 12 months of 1849.

      This was used by William Farr (GRO & Farr, 1852, Plate 2) to
      produce a time series chart of these deaths, in which he also
      recorded various meteorological phenomena (barometer, wind, rain),
      to see if he could find any patterns. This chart is available on
      the web site for Friendly & Wainer (2021) as Fig 4.1,
      https://friendly.github.io/HistDataVis/figs-web/04_1-cholera-diarrhea.png.

      James Riley (2023) notes, "Cholera 1849 has special significance â€”
      it is likely to be one of few modern pandemics that was completely
      unmitigated."
