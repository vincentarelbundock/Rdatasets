      .. rubric:: Pearson and Lee's data on the heights of parents and
         children classified by gender

         :name: description

      Wachsmuth et. al (2003) noticed that a loess smooth through
      Galton's data on heights of mid-parents and their offspring
      exhibited a slightly non-linear trend, and asked whether this
      might be due to Galton having pooled the heights of fathers and
      mothers and sons and daughters in constructing his tables and
      graphs.

      To answer this question, they used analogous data from English
      families at about the same time, tabulated by Karl Pearson and
      Alice Lee (1896, 1903), but where the heights of parents and
      children were each classified by gender of the parent.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame with 746 observations on the following 6
      variables.

      ``child``
         child height in inches, a numeric vector

      ``parent``
         parent height in inches, a numeric vector

      ``frequency``
         a numeric vector

      ``gp``
         a factor with levels ``fd`` ``fs`` ``md`` ``ms``

      ``par``
         a factor with levels ``Father`` ``Mother``

      ``chl``
         a factor with levels ``Daughter`` ``Son``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The variables ``gp``, ``par`` and ``chl`` are provided to allow
      stratifying the data according to the gender of the father/mother
      and son/daughter.
