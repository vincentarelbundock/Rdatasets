      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Waite (1915) was interested in analyzing the association of
      patterns in fingerprints, and produced a table of counts for 2000
      right hands, classified by the number of fingers describable as a
      "whorl", a "small loop" (or neither). Because each hand
      contributes five fingers, the number of ``Whorls + Loops`` cannot
      exceed 5, so the contingency table is necessarily triangular.

      Karl Pearson (1904) introduced the test for independence in
      contingency tables, and by 1913 had developed methods for
      "restricted contingency tables," such as the triangular table
      analyzed by Waite. The general formulation of such tests for
      association in restricted tables is now referred to as models for
      quasi-independence.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame with 36 observations on the following 3
      variables, representing a 6 x 6 table giving the
      cross-classification of the fingers on 2000 right hands as a
      whorl, small loop or neither.

      ``Whorls``
         Number of whorls, an ordered factor with levels ``0`` < ``1`` <
         ``2`` < ``3`` < ``4`` < ``5``

      ``Loops``
         Number of small loops, an ordered factor with levels ``0`` <
         ``1`` < ``2`` < ``3`` < ``4`` < ``5``

      ``count``
         Number of hands

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details
