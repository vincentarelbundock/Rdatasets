      Mayer had twenty-seven days' observations of Manilius and only
      three unknowns. The form of Mayer's problem is almost the same as
      that of Legendre, who developed later the least squares method.

      "How did Mayer address his overdetermined system of equations? His
      approach was a simple and straightforward one, so simple and
      straightforward that a twentieth-century reader might arrive at
      the very mistaken opinion that the procedure was not remarkable at
      all. Mayer divided his equations into three groups of nine
      equations each, added each of the three groups separately, and
      solved the resulting three linear equations for ``\alpha``,
      ``\beta`` and ``\alpha sin\theta`` (and then solved for
      ``\theta``). His choice of which equations belonged in which
      groups was based upon the coefficients of ``\alpha`` and
      ``\alpha sin \theta``. The first group consisted of the nine
      equations with the largest positive values for the coefficient of
      a, namely, equations 1,2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11,12, and 27. The second
      group were those with the nine largest negative values for this
      coefficient: equations 8, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26. The
      remaining nine equations formed the third group, which he
      described as having the largest values for the coefficient of
      ``\alpha sin \theta``."

      Stigler (1986):

      "The development of the method of least squares was closely
      associated with three of the major scientific problems of the
      eighteenth century: (1) to determine and represent mathematically
      the motions of the moon; (2) to account for an apparently secular
      (that is, nonperiodic) inequality that had been observed in the
      motions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn; and (3) to determine
      the shape or figure of the earth. These problems all involved
      astronomical observations and the theory of gravitational
      attraction, and they all presented intellectual challenges that
      engaged the attention of many of the ablest mathematical
      scientists of the period.

      Over the period from April 1748 to March 1749, Mayer made numerous
      observations of the positions of several prominent lunar features;
      and in his 1750 memoir he showed how these data could be used to
      determine various characteristics of the moon's orbit. His method
      of handling the data was novel, and it is well worth considering
      this method in detail, both for the light it sheds on his
      pioneering, if limited, understanding of the problem and because
      his approach was widely circulated in the major contemporary
      treatise on astronomy, having signal influence upon later work."

      His analysis led to this equation:

      ``\beta - (90-h) = \alpha sin(g-k) - \alpha sin\theta cos(g-k)``

      According to Stigler (1986, p. 21), this "equation would hold if
      no errors were present. The modern tendency would be to write,
      say":

      ``(h - 90) = - \beta + \alpha sin (g - k) - \alpha sin\theta cos(g - k) + E``

      treating ``(h - 90)`` as the dependent variable and ``-\beta``,
      ``\alpha``, and ``-\alpha sin \theta`` as the parameters in a
      linear regression model.
