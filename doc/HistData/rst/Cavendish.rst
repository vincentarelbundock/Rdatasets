      .. rubric:: Cavendish's Determinations of the Density of the Earth
         :name: cavendishs-determinations-of-the-density-of-the-earth

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Henry Cavendish carried out a series of experiments in 1798 to
      determine the mean density of the earth, as an indirect means to
      calculate the gravitational constant, G, in Newton's formula for
      the force (f) of gravitational attraction, ``f = G m M / r^2``
      between two bodies of mass m and M.

      Stigler (1977) used these data to illustrate properties of robust
      estimators with real, historical data. For these data sets, he
      found that trimmed means performed as well or better than more
      elaborate robust estimators.

         :name: format

      A data frame with 29 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``density``
         Cavendish's 29 determinations of the mean density of the earth

      ``density2``
         same as ``density``, with the third value (4.88) replaced by
         5.88

      ``density3``
         same as ``density``, omitting the the first 6 observations

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Density values (D) of the earth are given as relative to that of
      water. If the earth is regarded as a sphere of radius R, Newton's
      law can be expressed as ``G D = 3 g / (4 \pi R)``, where
      ``g=9.806 m/s^2`` is the acceleration due to gravity; so G is
      proportional to 1/D.

      ``density`` contains Cavendish's measurements as analyzed, where
      he treated the value 4.88 as if it were 5.88. ``density2``
      corrects this. Cavendish also changed his experimental apparatus
      after the sixth determination, using a stiffer wire in the torsion
      balance. ``density3`` replaces the first 6 values with ``NA``.

      The modern "true" value of D is taken as 5.517. The gravitational
      constant can be expressed as ``G = 6.674 * 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2``.
