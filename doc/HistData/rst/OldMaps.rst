      .. rubric:: Latitudes and Longitudes of 39 Points in 11 Old Maps
         :name: latitudes-and-longitudes-of-39-points-in-11-old-maps

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data set is concerned with the problem of aligning the
      coordinates of points read from old maps (1688 - 1818) of the
      Great Lakes area. 39 easily identifiable points were selected in
      the Great Lakes area, and their (lat, long) coordinates were
      recorded using a grid overlaid on each of 11 old maps, and using
      linear interpolation.

      It was conjectured that maps might be systematically in error in
      five key ways: (a) constant error in latitude; (b)constant error
      in longitude; (c) proportional error in latitude; (d)proportional
      error in longitude; (e) angular error from a non-zero difference
      between true North and the map's North.

      One challenge from these data is to produce useful analyses and
      graphical displays that relate to these characteristics or to
      other aspects of the data.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 468 observations on the following 6 variables,
      giving the latitude and longitude of 39 points recorded from 12
      sources (Actual + 11 maps).

      ``point``
         a numeric vector

      ``col``
         Column in the table a numeric vector

      ``name``
         Name of the map maker, using ``Actual`` for the true
         coordinates of the points. A factor with levels ``Actual``
         ``Arrowsmith`` ``Belin`` ``Cary`` ``Coronelli``
         ``D'Anville} \code{Del'Isle`` ``Lattre`` ``Melish``
         ``Mitchell`` ``Popple``

      ``year``
         Year of the map

      ``lat``
         Latitude

      ``long``
         Longitude

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Some of the latitude and longitude values are inexplicably
      negative. It is probable that this is an error in type setting,
      because the table footnote says "\* denotes that interpolation
      accuracy is not good," yet no "\*"s appear in the body of the
      table.
