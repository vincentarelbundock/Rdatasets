         Derivatives

         :name: description

      Cushny and Peebles (1905) studied the effects of hydrobromides
      related to scopolamine and atropine in producing sleep. The sleep
      of mental patients was measured without hypnotic (``Control``) and
      after treatment with one of three drugs: L. hyoscyamine
      hydrobromide (``L_hyoscyamine``), L. hyoscine hydrobromide
      (``L_hyoscyine``), and a mixture (racemic) form, ``DL_hyoscine``,
      called atropine. The L (levo) and D (detro) form of a given
      molecule are optical isomers (mirror images).

      The drugs were given on alternate evenings, and the hours of sleep
      were compared with the intervening control night. Each of the
      drugs was tested in this manner a varying number of times in each
      subject. The average number of hours of sleep for each treatment
      is the response.

      Student (1908) used these data to illustrate the paired-sample
      t-test in small samples, testing the hypothesis that the mean
      difference between a given drug and the control condition was
      zero. This data set became well known when used by Fisher (1925).
      Both Student and Fisher had problems labeling the drugs correctly
      (see Senn & Richardson (1994)), and consequently came to wrong
      conclusions.

      But as well, the sample sizes (number of nights) for each mean
      differed widely, ranging from 3-9, and this was not taken into
      account in their analyses. To allow weighted analyses, the number
      of observations for each mean is contained in the data frame
      ``CushnyPeeblesN``.

      ``CushnyPeebles``: A data frame with 11 observations on the
      following 4 variables.

      ``Control``
         a numeric vector: mean hours of sleep

      ``L_hyoscyamine``
         a numeric vector: mean hours of sleep

      ``L_hyoscine``
         a numeric vector: mean hours of sleep

      ``D_hyoscine``
         a numeric vector: mean hours of sleep

      ``CushnyPeeblesN``: A data frame with 11 observations on the
      following 4 variables.

      ``Control``
         a numeric vector: number of observations

      ``L_hyoscyamine``
         a numeric vector: number of observations

      ``L_hyoscine``
         a numeric vector: number of observations

      ``DL_hyoscine``
         a numeric vector: number of observations

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The last patient (11) has no ``Control`` observations, and so is
      often excluded in analyses or other versions of this data set.
