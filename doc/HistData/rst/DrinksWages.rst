      In 1910, Karl Pearson weighed in on the debate, fostered by the
      temperance movement, on the evils done by alcohol not only to
      drinkers, but to their families. The report "A first study of the
      influence of parental alcoholism on the physique and ability of
      their offspring" was an ambitious attempt to the new methods of
      statistics to bear on an important question of social policy, to
      see if the hypothesis that children were damaged by parental
      alcoholism would stand up to statistical scrutiny.

      Working with his assistant, Ethel M. Elderton, Pearson collected
      voluminous data in Edinburgh and Manchester on many aspects of
      health, stature, intelligence, etc. of children classified
      according to the drinking habits of their parents. His conclusions
      where almost invariably negative: the tendency of parents to drink
      appeared unrelated to any thing he had measured.

      The firestorm that this report set off is well described by
      Stigler (1999), Chapter 1. The data set ``DrinksWages`` is just
      one of Pearson's many tables, that he published in a letter to
      *The Times*, August 10, 1910.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 70 observations on the following 6 variables,
      giving the number of non-drinkers (``sober``) and drinkers
      (``drinks``) in various occupational categories (``trade``).

      ``class``
         wage class: a factor with levels ``A`` ``B`` ``C``

      ``trade``
         a factor with levels ``baker`` ``barman`` ``billposter`` ...
         ``wellsinker`` ``wireworker``

      ``sober``
         the number of non-drinkers, a numeric vector

      ``drinks``
         the number of drinkers, a numeric vector

      ``wage``
         weekly wage (in shillings), a numeric vector

      ``n``
         total number, a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data give Karl Pearson's tabulation of the father's trades
      from an Edinburgh sample, classified by whether they drink or are
      sober, and giving average weekly wage.

      The wages are averages of the individuals' nominal wages. Class A
      is those with wages under 2.5s.; B: those with wages 2.5s. to
      30s.; C: wages over 30s.
