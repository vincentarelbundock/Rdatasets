      .. rubric:: Florence Nightingale's data on deaths from various
         causes in the Crimean War

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      In the history of data visualization, Florence Nightingale is best
      remembered for her role as a social activist and her view that
      statistical data, presented in charts and diagrams, could be used
      as powerful arguments for medical reform.

      After witnessing deplorable sanitary conditions in the Crimea, she
      wrote several influential texts (Nightingale, 1858, 1859),
      including polar-area graphs (sometimes called "Coxcombs" or rose
      diagrams), showing the number of deaths in the Crimean from battle
      compared to disease or preventable causes that could be reduced by
      better battlefield nursing care.

      Her *Diagram of the Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East*
      showed that most of the British soldiers who died during the
      Crimean War died of sickness rather than of wounds or other
      causes. It also showed that the death rate was higher in the first
      year of the war, before a Sanitary Commissioners arrived in March
      1855 to improve hygiene in the camps and hospitals.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 24 observations on the following 10 variables.

      ``Date``
         a Date, composed as
         ``as.Date(paste(Year, Month, 1, sep='-'), "%Y-%b-%d")``

      ``Month``
         Month of the Crimean War, an ordered factor

      ``Year``
         Year of the Crimean War

      ``Army``
         Estimated average monthly strength of the British army

      ``Disease``
         Number of deaths from preventable or mitagable zymotic diseases

      ``Wounds``
         Number of deaths directly from battle wounds

      ``Other``
         Number of deaths from other causes

      ``Disease.rate``
         Annual rate of deaths from preventable or mitagable zymotic
         diseases, per 1000

      ``Wounds.rate``
         Annual rate of deaths directly from battle wounds, per 1000

      ``Other.rate``
         Annual rate of deaths from other causes, per 1000

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      For a given cause of death, ``D``, annual rates per 1000 are
      calculated as ``12 * 1000 * D / Army``, rounded to 1 decimal.

      The two panels of Nightingale's Coxcomb correspond to dates before
      and after March 1855
