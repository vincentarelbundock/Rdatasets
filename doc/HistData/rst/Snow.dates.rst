      .. rubric:: John Snow's Map and Data on the 1854 London Cholera
         Outbreak
         :name: john-snows-map-and-data-on-the-1854-london-cholera-outbreak

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Snow`` data consists of the relevant 1854 London streets,
      the location of 578 deaths from cholera, and the position of 13
      water pumps (wells) that can be used to re-create John Snow's map
      showing deaths from cholera in the area surrounding Broad Street,
      London in the 1854 outbreak. Another data frame provides
      boundaries of a tessellation of the map into Thiessen (Voronoi)
      regions which include all cholera deaths nearer to a given pump
      than to any other.

      The apocryphal story of the significance of Snow's map is that, by
      closing the Broad Street pump (by removing its handle), Dr. Snow
      stopped the epidemic, and demonstrated that cholera is a water
      borne disease. The method of contagion of cholera was not
      previously understood. Snow's map is the most famous and classical
      example in the field of medical cartography, even if it didn't
      happen exactly this way. (the apocryphal part is that the epidemic
      ended when the pump handle was removed.) At any rate, the map,
      together with various statistical annotations, is compelling
      because it points to the Broad Street pump as the source of the
      outbreak.

      ``Snow.deaths``: A data frame with 578 observations on the
      following 3 variables, giving the address of a person who died
      from cholera. When many points are associated with a single street
      address, they are "stacked" in a line away from the street so that
      they are more easily visualized. This is how they are displayed on
      John Snow's original map. The dates of the deaths are not
      individually recorded in this data set.

      ``case``
         Sequential case number, in some arbitrary, randomized order

      ``x``
         x coordinate

      ``y``
         y coordinate

      ``Snow.pumps``: A data frame with 13 observations on the following
      4 variables, giving the locations of water pumps within the
      boundaries of the map.

      ``pump``
         pump number

      ``label``
         pump label: ``Briddle St`` ``Broad St`` ... ``Warwick``

      ``x``
         x coordinate

      ``y``
         y coordinate

      ``Snow.streets``: A data frame with 1241 observations on the
      following 4 variables, giving coordinates used to draw the 528
      street segment lines within the boundaries of the map. The map is
      created by drawing lines connecting the ``n`` points in each
      street segment.

      ``street``
         street segment number: ``1:528``

      ``n``
         number of points in this street line segment

      ``x``
         x coordinate

      ``y``
         y coordinate

      ``Snow.polygons``: A list of 13 data frames, giving the vertices
      of Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons containing each pump. Their
      boundaries define the area that is closest to each pump relative
      to all other pumps. They are mathematically defined by the
      perpendicular bisectors of the lines between all pumps. Each data
      frame contains:

      ``x``
         x coordinate

      ``y``
         y coordinate

      ``Snow.deaths2``: An alternative version of ``Snow.deaths``
      correcting some possible duplicate and missing cases, as described
      in ``vignette("Snow_deaths-duplicates")``.

      ``Snow.dates``: A data frame of 44 observations and 3 variables
      from Table 1 of Snow (1855), giving the number of fatal attacks
      and number of deaths by date from Aug. 19 – Sept. 30, 1854. There
      are a total of 616 deaths represented in both columns ``attacks``
      and ``deaths``; of these, the date of the attack is unknown for 45
      cases.

      The scale of the source map is approx. 1:2000. The ``(x, y)``
      coordinate units are 100 meters, with an arbitrary origin.

      Of the data in the ``Snow.dates`` table, Snow says, “The deaths in
      the above table are compiled from the sources mentioned above in
      describing the map; but some deaths which were omitted from the
      map on account of the number of the house not being known, are
      included in the table.”

      One limitation of these data sets is the lack of exact street
      addresses. Another is the lack of any data that would serve as a
      population denominator to allow for a comparison of mortality
      rates in the Broad Street pump area as opposed to others. See Koch
      (2000), Koch (2004), Koch & Denike (2009) and Tufte (1999), p.
      27-37, for further discussion.
