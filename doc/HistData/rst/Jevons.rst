         :name: description

      In a remarkable brief note in *Nature*, 1871, W. Stanley Jevons
      described the results of an experiment he had conducted on himself
      to determine the limits of the number of objects an observer could
      comprehend immediately without counting them. This was an
      important philosophical question: How many objects can the mind
      embrace at once?

      He carried out 1027 trials in which he tossed an "uncertain
      number" of uniform black beans into a box and immediately
      attempted to estimate the number "without the least hesitation".
      His questions, procedure and analysis anticipated by 75 years one
      of the most influential papers in modern cognitive psychology by
      George Miller (1956), "The magical number 7 plus or minus 2: Some
      limits on ..." For Jevons, the magical number was 4.5,
      representing an empirical law of complete accuracy.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame with 50 observations on the following 4
      variables.

      ``actual``
         Actual number: a numeric vector

      ``estimated``
         Estimated number: a numeric vector

      ``frequency``
         Frequency of this combination of (actual, estimated): a numeric
         vector

      ``error``
         ``actual``-``estimated``: a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The original data were presented in a two-way, 13 x 13 frequency
      table, ``estimated`` (3:15) x ``actual`` (3:15).
