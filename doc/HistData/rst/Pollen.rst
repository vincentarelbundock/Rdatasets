      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A synthetic dataset generated by David Coleman at RCA Laboratories
      in Princeton, N.J and used in the 1986 American Statistical
      Association JSM meeting as a data challenge for the Statistical
      Graphics Section.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("Pollen")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 3848 observations on the following 5 variables,
      representing ficticious measurements of grains of pollen.

      ``ridge``
         along X, a numeric vector

      ``nub``
         along y, a numeric vector

      ``crack``
         along z, a numeric vector

      ``weight``
         weight of pollen grain, a numeric vector

      ``density``
         weight of pollen grain, a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The first three variables are the lengths of geometric features
      observed sampled pollen grains - in the x, y, and z dimensions: a
      "ridge" along x, a "nub" in the y direction, and a "crack" in
      along the z dimension. The fourth variable is pollen grain weight,
      and the fifth is density.

      In the description for the data challenge: "the data analyst is
      advised that there is more than one "feature" to these data. Each
      feature can be observed through various graphical techniques, but
      analytic methods, as well, can help "crack" the dataset."

      There were several features embedded in this dataset: clusters of
      points, 5D ellipsoidal voids with no points, and finally, a
      collection of points which spelled out "EUREKA".

      Papers by Becker et al. (1986) and Slomka (1986) describe their
      work on this problem.

      Yihui Xie used this data as an illustration of the animate
      package, using rgl to zoom in on the magic word. See the video on
      https://vimeo.com/1982725.

      The canonical source for this data is the StatLib – Datasets
      Archive https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/pollen.data in the
      inconvenient form of .sh archive.

      It is also available as ``data(pollen, package="animate")``.
