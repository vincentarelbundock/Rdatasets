         Pairs

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Darwin (1876) studied the growth of pairs of zea may (aka corn)
      seedlings, one produced by cross-fertilization and the other
      produced by self-fertilization, but otherwise grown under
      identical conditions. His goal was to demonstrate the greater
      vigour of the cross-fertilized plants. The data recorded are the
      final height (inches, to the nearest 1/8th) of the plants in each
      pair.

      In the *Design of Experiments*, Fisher (1935) used these data to
      illustrate a paired t-test (well, a one-sample test on the mean
      difference, ``cross - self``). Later in the book (section 21), he
      used this data to illustrate an early example of a non-parametric
      permutation test, treating each paired difference as having
      (randomly) either a positive or negative sign.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 15 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``pair``
         pair number, a numeric vector

      ``pot``
         pot, a factor with levels ``1`` ``2`` ``3`` ``4``

      ``cross``
         height of cross fertilized plant, a numeric vector

      ``self``
         height of self fertilized plant, a numeric vector

      ``diff``
         ``cross - self`` for each pair

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      In addition to the standard paired t-test, several types of
      non-parametric tests can be contemplated:

      (a) Permutation test, where the values of, say ``self`` are
      permuted and ``diff=cross - self`` is calculated for each
      permutation. There are 15! permutations, but a reasonably large
      number of random permutations would suffice. But this doesn't take
      the paired samples into account.

      (b) Permutation test based on assigning each ``abs(diff)`` a + or
      - sign, and calculating the mean(diff). There are ``2^{15}`` such
      possible values. This is essentially what Fisher proposed. The
      p-value for the test is the proportion of absolute mean
      differences under such randomization which exceed the observed
      mean difference.

      (c) Wilcoxon signed rank test: tests the hypothesis that the
      median signed rank of the ``diff`` is zero, or that the
      distribution of ``diff`` is symmetric about 0, vs. a location
      shifted alternative.
