         :name: description

      Edgeworth (1885) took the first 75 lines in Book XI of Virgil's
      *Aeneid* and classified each of the first four "feet" of the line
      as a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short ones) or not.

      Grouping the lines in blocks of five gave a 4 x 25 table of
      counts, represented here as a data frame with ordered factors,
      ``Foot`` and ``Lines``. Edgeworth used this table in what was
      among the first examples of analysis of variance applied to a
      two-way classification.

         :name: format

      A data frame with 60 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``Foot``
         an ordered factor with levels ``1`` < ``2`` < ``3`` < ``4``

      ``Lines``
         an ordered factor with levels ``1:5`` < ``6:10`` < ``11:15`` <
         ``16:20`` < ``21:25`` < ``26:30`` < ``31:35`` < ``36:40`` <
         ``41:45`` < ``46:50`` < ``51:55`` < ``56:60`` < ``61:65`` <
         ``66:70`` < ``71:75``

      ``count``
         number of dactyls
