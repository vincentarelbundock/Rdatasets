      In one of the first statistical textbooks, Arthur Bowley (1901)
      used these data to illustrate an arithmetic and graphical analysis
      of time-series data using the total value of British and Irish
      exports from 1855-1899. He presented a line graph of the
      time-series data, supplemented by overlaid line graphs of 3-, 5-
      and 10-year moving averages. His goal was to show that while the
      initial series showed wide variability, moving averages made the
      series progressively smoother.
