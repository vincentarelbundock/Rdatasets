      .. rubric:: Galton's data on the heights of parents and their
         children, by child
         :name: galtons-data-on-the-heights-of-parents-and-their-children-by-child

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data set lists the individual observations for 934 children
      in 205 families on which Galton (1886) based his cross-tabulation.

      In addition to the question of the relation between heights of
      parents and their offspring, for which this data is mainly famous,
      Galton had another purpose which the data in this form allows to
      address: Does marriage selection indicate a relationship between
      the heights of husbands and wives, a topic he called *assortative
      mating*? Keen [p. 297-298](2010) provides a brief discussion of
      this topic.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 934 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``family``
         family ID, a factor with levels ``001``-``204``

      ``father``
         height of father

      ``mother``
         height of mother

      ``midparentHeight``
         mid-parent height, calculated as ``(father + 1.08*mother)/2``

      ``children``
         number of children in this family

      ``childNum``
         number of this child within family. Children are listed in
         decreasing order of height for boys followed by girls

      ``gender``
         child gender, a factor with levels ``female`` ``male``

      ``childHeight``
         height of child

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Galton's notebook lists 963 children in 205 families ranging from
      1-15 adult children children. Of these, 29 had non-numeric heights
      recorded and are not included here.

      Families are largely listed in descending order of fathers and
      mothers height.
