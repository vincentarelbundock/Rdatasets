         :name: description

      With this dataset Laplace (1787) showed that "noticed defects in
      the then existing tables of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn"
      were, *de facto*, due to "a very long, 917-year, periodic
      inequality in the planets' mean motion, due to their mutual
      attraction and the coincidence that their times of revolution
      about the sun are approximately in the ratio 5:2".

         data(Saturn)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 24 observations on the following 6 variables.

      ``Equation``
         an integer vector, id of the Equation

      ``Year``
         an integer vector, year of the observations

      ``Y``
         a numeric vector, adjusted measure of the observed longitude of
         Saturn, in minutes

      ``X1``
         a numeric vector, the rate of change of the mean annual motion
         of Saturn

      ``X2``
         a numeric vector, the rate of change of the eccentricity of
         Saturn's orbit

      ``X3``
         a numeric vector, a variable compound of the rate of change of
         Saturn's aphelion minus rates of change of the mean longitude
         of Saturn in 1750, multiplied by 2 times the mean eccentricity
         of Saturn

      Stigler (1986, pp. 25-39):

      "In 1676 Halley had verified an earlier suspicion of Horrocks that
      the motions of Jupiter and Saturn were subject to slight,
      apparently secular, inequalities. When the actual positions of
      Jupiter and Saturn were compared with the tabulated observations
      of many centuries, it appeared that the mean motion of Jupiter was
      accelerating, whereas that of Saturn was retarding. Halley was
      able to improve the accuracy of the tables by an empirical
      adjustment, and he speculated that the irregularity was somehow
      due to the mutual attraction of the planets. But he was unable to
      provide a mathematical theory that would account for this
      inequality.

      If the observed trends were to continue indefinitely, Jupiter
      would crash into the sun as Saturn receded into space! The problem
      posed by the Academy could be (and was) interpreted as requiring
      the development of an extension of existing theories of attraction
      to incorporate the mutual attraction of three bodies, in order to
      see whether such a theory could account for at least the major
      observed inequalities as, it was hoped, periodic in nature. Thus
      stability would be restored to the solar system, and Newtonian
      gravitational theory would have overcome another obstacle.

      The problem was an extraordinarily difficult one for the time, and
      Euler's attempts to grope for a solution are most revealing.
      Euler's work was, in comparison with Mayer's a year later, a
      statistical failure. After he had found values for *n* and *u*,
      Euler had the data needed to produce seventy-five equations, all
      linear in *x, y, m, z, a*, and *k*. He might have added them
      together in six groups and solved for the unknowns, but he
      attempted no such overall combination of the equations.

      Laplace had come quite a bit closer to providing a general method
      than ``Mayer`` had. Indeed, it was Laplace's generalization that
      enjoyed popularity throughout the first half of the nineteenth
      century, as a method that provided some of the accuracy expected
      from least squares, with much less labor. Because the multipliers
      were all -1, 0, or 1, no multiplication, only addition, was
      required."
