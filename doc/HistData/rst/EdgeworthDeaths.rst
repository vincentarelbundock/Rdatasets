      .. rubric:: Edgeworth's Data on Death Rates in British Counties
         :name: edgeworths-data-on-death-rates-in-british-counties

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      In 1885, Francis Edgeworth published a paper, *On methods of
      ascertaining variations in the rate of births, deaths and
      marriages*. It contained among the first examples of two-way
      tables, analyzed to show variation among row and column factors,
      in a way that Fisher would later formulate as the Analysis of
      Variance.

      Although the data are rates per 1000, they provide a good example
      of a two-way ANOVA with n=1 per cell, where an additive model fits
      reasonably well.

      Treated as frequencies, the data is also a good example of a case
      where the independence model fits reasonably well.

         :name: usage

      ::

         data("EdgeworthDeaths")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 42 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``County``
         a factor with levels ``Berks`` ``Herts`` ``Bucks`` ``Oxford``
         ``Bedford`` ``Cambridge``

      ``year``
         an ordered factor with levels ``1876`` < ``1877`` < ``1878`` <
         ``1879`` < ``1880`` < ``1881`` < ``1882``

      ``Freq``
         a numeric vector, death rate per 1000 population

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Edgeworth's data came from the Registrar General's report for the
      final year, 1883. The ``Freq`` variable represents death rates per
      1000 population in the six counties listed.

      .. rubric:: Source

      The data were scanned from Table 5.2 in Stigler, S. M. (1999)

      Methods*, Harvard University Press.
