         :name: description

      Playfair (1821) used a graph, showing parallel time-series of the
      price of wheat and the typical weekly wage for a "good mechanic"
      from 1565 to 1821 to argue that working men had never been as
      well-off in terms of purchasing power as they had become toward
      the end of this period.

      His graph is a classic in the history of data visualization, but
      commits the sin of showing two non-commensurable Y variables on
      different axes. Scatterplots of wages vs. price or plots of ratios
      (e.g., wages/price) are in some ways better, but both of these
      ideas were unknown in 1821.

      In this version, information on the reigns of British monarchs is
      provided in a separate data.frame, ``Wheat.monarch``.
