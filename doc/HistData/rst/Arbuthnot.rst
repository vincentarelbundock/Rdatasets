         :name: description

      John Arbuthnot (1710) used these time series data on the ratios of
      male to female christenings in London from 1629-1710 to carry out
      the first known significance test, comparing observed data to a
      null hypothesis. The data for these 81 years showed that in every
      year there were more male than female christenings.

      On the assumption that male and female births were equally likely,
      he showed that the probability of observing 82 years with more
      males than females was vanishingly small (``~ 4.14 x 10^{-25}``).
      He used this to argue that a nearly constant birth ratio > 1 could
      be interpreted to show the guiding hand of a devine being. The
      data set adds variables of deaths from the plague and total
      mortality obtained by Campbell and from Creighton (1965).

      Sandy Zabell (1976) pointed out several errors and inconsistencies
      in the Arbuthnot data. In particular, the values for 1674 and 1704
      are identical, suggesting that the latter were copied erroneously
      from the former.

      Jim Oeppen <joeppen@health.sdu.dk> points out that: "Arbuthnot's
      data are annual counts of public baptisms, not births.
      Birth-baptism delay meant that infant deaths could occur before
      baptism. As male infants are more likely to die than females, the
      sex ratio at baptism might be expected to be lower than the
      'normal' male- female birth ratio of 105:100. These effects were
      not constant as there were trends in birth-baptism delay, and in
      early infant mortality. In addition, the English Civil War and
      Commonwealth period 1642-1660 is thought to have been a period of
      both under-registration and lower fertility, but it is not clear
      whether these had sex-specific effects."
