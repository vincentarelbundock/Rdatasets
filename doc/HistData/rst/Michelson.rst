      .. rubric:: Michelson's Determinations of the Velocity of Light
         :name: michelsons-determinations-of-the-velocity-of-light

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data frame ``Michelson`` gives Albert Michelson's measurements
      of the velocity of light in air, made from June 5 to July 2, 1879,
      reported in Michelson (1882). The given values + 299,000 are
      Michelson's measurements in km/sec. The number of cases is 100 and
      the "true" value on this scale is 734.5.

      Stigler (1977) used these data to illustrate properties of robust
      estimators with real, historical data. For this purpose, he
      divided the 100 measurements into 5 sets of 20 each. These are
      contained in ``MichelsonSets``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The "true" value is taken to be 734.5, arrived at by taking the
      "true" speed of light in a vacuum to be 299,792.5 km/sec, and
      adjusting for the velocity in air.

      The data values are recorded in order, and so may also be taken as
      a time series.
