         :name: description

      Andre-Michel Guerry (1833) was the first to systematically collect
      and analyze social data on such things as crime, literacy and
      suicide with the view to determining social laws and the relations
      among these variables.

      The Guerry data frame comprises a collection of 'moral variables'
      on the 86 departments of France around 1830. A few additional
      variables have been added from other sources.

      Note that most of the variables (e.g., ``Crime_pers``) are scaled
      so that 'more is better' morally.

      Values for the quantitative variables displayed on Guerry's maps
      were taken from Table A2 in the English translation of Guerry
      (1833) by Whitt and Reinking. Values for the ranked variables were
      taken from Table A1, with some corrections applied. The maximum is
      indicated by rank 1, and the minimum by rank 86.
