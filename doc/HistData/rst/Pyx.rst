         :name: trial-of-the-pyx

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Stigler (1997, 1999) recounts the history of one of the oldest
      continuous schemes of sampling inspection carried out by the Royal
      Mint in London for about eight centuries. The Trial of the Pyx was
      the final, ceremonial stage in a process designed to ensure that
      the weight and quality of gold and silver coins from the mint met
      the standards for coinage.

      At regular intervals, coins would be taken from production and
      deposited into a box called the Pyx. When a Trial of the Pyx was
      called, the contents of the Pyx would be counted, weighed and
      assayed for content, and the results would be compared with the
      standard set for the Royal Mint.

      The data frame ``Pyx`` gives the results for the year 1848 (Great
      Britain, 1848) in which 10,000 gold sovereigns were assayed. The
      coins in each bag were classified according to the deviation from
      the standard content of gold for each coin, called the Remedy, R =
      123 \* (12/5760) = .25625, in grains, for a single sovereign.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A frequency data frame with 72 observations on the following 4
      variables giving the distribution of 10,000 sovereigns, classified
      according to the ``Bags`` in which they were collected and the
      ``Deviation`` from the standard weight.

      ``Bags``
         an ordered factor with levels ``1 and 2`` < ``3`` < ``4`` <
         ``5`` < ``6`` < ``7`` < ``8`` < ``9`` < ``10``

      ``Group``
         an ordered factor with levels ``below std`` < ``near std`` <
         ``above std``

      ``Deviation``
         an ordered factor with levels ``Below -R`` < ``(-R to -.2)`` <
         ``(-.2 to -.l)`` < ``(-.1 to 0)`` < ``(0 to .l)`` <
         ``(.1 to .2)`` < ``(.2 to R)`` < ``Above R``

      ``count``
         number of sovereigns

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``Bags`` 1-4 were selected as "near to standard", bags 5-7 as
      below standard, bags 8-10 as above standard. This classification
      is reflected in ``Group``.
