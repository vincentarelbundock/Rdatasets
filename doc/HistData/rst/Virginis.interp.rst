         :name: description

      In 1833 J. F. W. Herschel published two papers in the *Memoirs of
      the Royal Astronomical Society* detailing his investigations of
      calculating the orbits of twin stars from observations of their
      relative position angle and angular distance.

      In the process, he invented the scatterplot, and the use of visual
      smoothing to obtain a reliable curve that surpassed the accuracy
      of individual observations (Friendly & Denis, 2005). His data on
      the recordings of the twin stars ``\gamma`` *Virginis* provide an
      accessible example of his methods.

      ``Virgins``: A data frame with 18 observations on the following 6
      variables giving the measurements of position angle and angular
      distance between the central (brightest) star and its twin,
      recorded by various observers over more than 100 years.

      ``year``
         year ("epoch") of the observation, a decimal numeric vector

      ``posangle``
         recorded position angle between the two stars, a numeric vector

      ``distance``
         separation distance between the two stars, a numeric vector

      ``weight``
         a subjective weight attributed to the accuracy of this
         observation, a numeric vector

      ``notes``
         Herschel's notes on this observation, a character vector

      ``authority``
         A simplified version of the notes giving just the attribution
         of authority of the observation, a character vector

      ``Virgins.interp``: A data frame with 14 observations on the
      following 4 variables, giving the position angles and angular
      distance that Herschel interpolated from his smoothed curve.

      ``year``
         year ("epoch") of the observation, a decimal numeric vector

      ``posangle``
         recorded position angle between the two stars, a numeric vector

      ``distance``
         separation distance, calculated ``1/sqrt(velocity)``

      ``velocity``
         angular velocity, calculated as the instantaneous slopes of
         tangents to the smoothed curve, a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data in ``Virginis`` come from the table on p. 35 of the
      “Micrometrical Measures” paper.

      The ``weight`` variable was assigned by the package author,
      reflecting Herschel's comments and for use in any weighted
      analysis.

      In the ``notes`` and ``authority`` variables, ``"H"`` refers to
      William Herschel (John's farther, the discoverer of the planet
      Uranus), ``"h"`` refers to John Herschel himself, and ``"Sigma"``,
      rendered ``\Sigma`` in the table on p. 35 refers to Joseph
      Fraunhofer.

      The data in ``Virginis.interp`` come from Table 1 on p. 190 of the
      supplementary paper.
