         :name: description

      Galton (1886) presented these data in a table, showing a
      cross-tabulation of 928 adult children born to 205 fathers and
      mothers, by their height and their mid-parent's height. He
      visually smoothed the bivariate frequency distribution and showed
      that the contours formed concentric and similar ellipses, thus
      setting the stage for correlation, regression and the bivariate
      normal distribution.

         :name: format

      A data frame with 928 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ``parent``
         a numeric vector: height of the mid-parent (average of father
         and mother)

      ``child``
         a numeric vector: height of the child

      The data are recorded in class intervals of width 1.0 in. He used
      non-integer values for the center of each class interval because
      of the strong bias toward integral inches.

      All of the heights of female children were multiplied by 1.08
      before tabulation to compensate for sex differences. See Hanley
      (2004) for a reanalysis of Galton's raw data questioning whether
      this was appropriate.
