      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      “A 2 x 2 factorial experiment comparing 2 types of seed and 2 root
      extracts. There are 5 or 6 replicates in each of the 4 treatment
      groups, and each replicate comprises a number of seeds varying
      between 4 and 81. The response variable is the proportion of seeds
      germinating in each replicate.” (Crowder, 1978, Table 3).
