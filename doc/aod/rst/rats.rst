   “Weil (1970) in Table 1 gives the results from an experiment
   comprising two treatments. One group of 16 pregnant female rats was
   fed a control diet during pregnancy and lactation, the diet of a
   second group of 16 pregnant females was treated with a chemical. For
   each litter the number ``n`` of pups alive at 4 days and the number
   ``x`` of pups that survived the 21 day lactation period were
   recorded.” (Williams, 1975, p. 951).
