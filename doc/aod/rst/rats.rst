      “Weil (1970) in Table 1 gives the results from an experiment
      comprising two treatments. One group of 16 pregnant female rats
      was fed a control diet during pregnancy and lactation, the diet of
      a second group of 16 pregnant females was treated with a chemical.
      For each litter the number ``n`` of pups alive at 4 days and the
      number ``x`` of pups that survived the 21 day lactation period
      were recorded.” (Williams, 1975, p. 951).
