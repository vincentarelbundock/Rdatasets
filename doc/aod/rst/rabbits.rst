   .. rubric:: Rabbits Foetuses Survival Experiment
      :name: rabbits-foetuses-survival-experiment

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Experimental data for analyzing the effect of an increasing dose of a
   compound on the proportion of live foetuses affected. Four
   treatment-groups were considered: control “C”, low dose “L”, medium
   dose “M” and high dose “H”. The animal species used in the experiment
   was banded Dutch rabbit (Paul, 1982, Table 1).
