      .. rubric:: Rabbits Foetuses Survival Experiment
         :name: rabbits-foetuses-survival-experiment

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Experimental data for analyzing the effect of an increasing dose
      of a compound on the proportion of live foetuses affected. Four
      treatment-groups were considered: control “C”, low dose “L”,
      medium dose “M” and high dose “H”. The animal species used in the
      experiment was banded Dutch rabbit (Paul, 1982, Table 1).
