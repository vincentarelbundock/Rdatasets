<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Information for this story is drawn from an original data set of special counsel, independent counsel and special prosecutor investigations from 1973 to 2019. The data set was created by consulting historical sources, including final reports generated by independent counsels, special counsels and special prosecutors; reports in Congressional Quarterly; and contemporaneous news stories. Secondary historical sources were also consulted, including a 2006 Congressional Research Service report about independent counsel investigations and a history of the Watergate investigation by Stanley Kutler. Data about pardons was obtained from the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Indicted organizations were excluded from our analysis. The data set, which is available on Github, includes the names of all people charged as part of these investigations, as well as the outcome of their cases and the dates of major actions in their cases.
