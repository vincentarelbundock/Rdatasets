      A dataset with 435 rows representing votes and 4 variables

      state
         the state of the vote

      district_number
         the district_number of the vote

      pvi_party
         the party of the vote

      pvi_amount
         the Cook Partisan Voting Index of the vote

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      The original dataset only has 2 columns: "district" and "pvi_538".
      I separated each of the 2 columns into two. For example, in row 1
      of the dataset, the original "district" = "AK-1", and I separated
      it into "state" = "Arkansas" and "district_number" = "1"; the
      original "pvi_538" = "R+15.21", and I separated it into
      â€œpvi_party" = "R" and "pvi_amount" = "15.21". In addition, I used
      the full names for all states instead of abbreviations.
