      The original 'masculinity-survey.csv' contains the results of a
      survey of 1,615 adult men conducted by SurveyMonkey in partnership
      with FiveThirtyEight and WNYC Studios from May 10-22, 2018. The
      modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 2.5
      percentage points. The percentages have been weighted for age,
      race, education, and geography using the Census Bureauâ€™s American
      Community Survey to reflect the demographic composition of the
      United States age 18 and over. Crosstabs with less than 100
      respondents have been left blank because responses would not be
      statistically significant. I made heavy editions in Excel to make
      the dataset easily usable in R.
