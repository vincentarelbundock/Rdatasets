      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A dataset with 50 rows representing states and 3 variables

      state
         the state

      pvi_party
         the party of the vote

      pvi_amount
         the Cook Partisan Voting Index of the vote

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      The original dataset only has 2 columns: "state" and "pvi_538". I
      separated the "pvi_538" columns into two. For example, in row 1 of
      the dataset, the original "pvi_538" = "R+27", and I separated it
      into â€œpvi_party" = "R" and "pvi_amount" = "27".
