      A dataset with 435 rows representing congressional districts and 2
      variables

      district
         congressional district

      pvi_538
         pvi

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      The original dataset only has 2 columns: "district" and
      "elasticity". I separated the "district" columns into two. For
      example, in row 1 of the dataset, the original "district" =
      "MI-5", and I separated it into â€œstate" = "Michigan" and
      "district_number" = "5". In addition, I used the full names for
      all states instead of abbreviations.

      An elasticity score measures how sensitive a state or district it
      is to changes in the national political environment.
