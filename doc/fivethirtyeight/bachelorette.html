<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Eliminates connote either an elimination (starts with &quot;E&quot;) or a rose
(starts with &quot;R&quot;). Eliminations supersede roses. &quot;E&quot; connotes a standard
elimination, typically at a rose ceremony. &quot;EQ&quot; means the contestant quits.
&quot;EF&quot; means the contestant was fired by production. &quot;ED&quot; connotes a date
elimination. &quot;EU&quot; connotes an unscheduled elimination, one that takes place
at a time outside of a date or rose ceremony. &quot;R&quot; means the contestant
received a rose. &quot;R1&quot; means the contestant got a first impression rose.
&quot;D1&quot; means a one-on-one date, &quot;D2&quot; means a 2-on-1, &quot;D3&quot; means a 3-on-1
group date, and so on. Weeks of the show are eliminated by rose
ceremonies, and may not line up exactly with episodes.
