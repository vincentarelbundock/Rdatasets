      .. rubric:: Bitterness of wine
         :name: bitterness-of-wine

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``wine`` data set is adopted from Randall(1989) and from a
      factorial experiment on factors determining the bitterness of
      wine. Two treatment factors (temperature and contact) each have
      two levels. Temperature and contact between juice and skins can be
      controlled when cruching grapes during wine production. Nine
      judges each assessed wine from two bottles from each of the four
      treatment conditions, hence there are 72 observations in all.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      ``response``
         scorings of wine bitterness on a 0—100 continuous scale.

      ``rating``
         ordered factor with 5 levels; a grouped version of
         ``response``.

      ``temp``
         temperature: factor with two levels.

      ``contact``
         factor with two levels (``"no"`` and ``"yes"``).

      ``bottle``
         factor with eight levels.

      ``judge``
         factor with nine levels.

      .. rubric:: Examples
         :name: examples

      .. code:: R

         head(wine)
         str(wine)

         ## Variables 'rating' and 'response' are related in the following way:
         (intervals <- seq(0,100, by = 20))
         all(wine$rating == findInterval(wine$response, intervals)) ## ok

         ## A few illustrative tabulations:
         ## Table matching Table 5 in Randall (1989):
         temp.contact.bottle <- with(wine, temp:contact:bottle)[drop=TRUE]
         xtabs(response ~ temp.contact.bottle + judge, data = wine)

         ## Table matching Table 6 in Randall (1989):
         with(wine, {
           tcb <- temp:contact:bottle
           tcb <- tcb[drop=TRUE]
           table(tcb, rating)
         })
         ## or simply: with(wine, table(bottle, rating))

         ## Table matching Table 1 in Tutz & Hennevogl (1996):
         tab <- xtabs(as.numeric(rating) ~ judge + temp.contact.bottle,
                      data = wine)
         colnames(tab) <-
           paste(rep(c("c","w"), each = 4), rep(c("n", "n", "y", "y"), 2),
                 1:8, sep=".")
         tab


         ## A simple model:
         m1 <- clm(rating ~ temp * contact, data = wine)
         summary(m1)
