         :name: discrimination-study-of-packet-soup

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``soup`` data frame has 1847 rows and 13 variables. 185
      respondents participated in an A-not A discrimination test with
      sureness. Before experimentation the respondents were familiarized
      with the reference product and during experimentation, the
      respondents were asked to rate samples on an ordered scale with
      six categories given by combinations of (reference, not reference)
      and (sure, not sure, guess) from 'referene, sure' = 1 to 'not
      reference, sure' = 6.
