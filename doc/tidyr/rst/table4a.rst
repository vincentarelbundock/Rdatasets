         :name: details

      ``table1``, ``table2``, ``table3``, ``table4a``, ``table4b``, and
      ``table5`` all display the number of TB cases documented by the
      World Health Organization in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China
      between 1999 and 2000. The data contains values associated with
      four variables (country, year, cases, and population), but each
      table organizes the values in a different layout.

      The data is a subset of the data contained in the World Health
      Organization Global Tuberculosis Report
