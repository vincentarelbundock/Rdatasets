      .. rubric:: World Health Organization TB data
         :name: world-health-organization-tb-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A subset of data from the World Health Organization Global
      Tuberculosis Report, and accompanying global populations. ``who``
      uses the original codes from the World Health Organization. The
      column names for columns 5 through 60 are made by combining
      ``new_`` with:

      -  the method of diagnosis (``rel`` = relapse, ``sn`` = negative
         pulmonary smear, ``sp`` = positive pulmonary smear, ``ep`` =
         extrapulmonary),

      -  gender (``f`` = female, ``m`` = male), and

      -  age group (``014`` = 0-14 yrs of age, ``1524`` = 15-24,
         ``2534`` = 25-34, ``3544`` = 35-44 years of age, ``4554`` =
         45-54, ``5564`` = 55-64, ``65`` = 65 years or older).

      ``who2`` is a lightly modified version that makes teaching the
      basics easier by tweaking the variables to be slightly more
      consistent and dropping ``iso2`` and ``iso3``. ``newrel`` is
      replaced by ``new_rel``, and a ``⁠_⁠`` is added after the gender.
