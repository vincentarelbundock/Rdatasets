      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Information about fish swimming down a river: each station
      represents an autonomous monitor that records if a tagged fish was
      seen at that location. Fish travel in one direction (migrating
      downstream). Information about misses is just as important as
      hits, but is not directly recorded in this form of the data.
