Details

``table1``, ``table2``, ``table3``, ``table4a``, ``table4b``, and
``table5`` all display the number of TB cases documented by the World
Health Organization in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China between 1999 and
2000. The data contains values associated with four variables (country,
year, cases, and population), but each table organizes the values in a
different layout.

The data is a subset of the data contained in the World Health
Organization Global Tuberculosis Report
