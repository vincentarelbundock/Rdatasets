      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These data sets describe band members of the Beatles and Rolling
      Stones. They are toy data sets that can be displayed in their
      entirety on a slide (e.g. to demonstrate a join).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``band_instruments`` and ``band_instruments2`` contain the same
      data but use different column names for the first column of the
      data set. ``band_instruments`` uses ``name``, which matches the
      name of the key column of ``band_members``; ``band_instruments2``
      uses ``artist``, which does not.
