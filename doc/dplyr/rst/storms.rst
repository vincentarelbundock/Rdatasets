      This dataset is the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database best track
      data, https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat. The data includes the
      positions and attributes of storms from 1975-2022. Storms from
      1979 onward are measured every six hours during the lifetime of
      the storm. Storms in earlier years have some missing data.
