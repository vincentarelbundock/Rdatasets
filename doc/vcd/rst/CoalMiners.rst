      .. rubric:: Breathlessness and Wheeze in Coal Miners
         :name: breathlessness-and-wheeze-in-coal-miners

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from Ashford & Sowden (1970) given by Agresti (1990) on the
      association between two pulmonary conditions, breathlessness and
      wheeze, in a large sample of coal miners who were smokers with no
      radiological evidence of pneumoconlosis, aged between 20–64 when
      examined. This data is frequently used as an example of fitting
      models for bivariate, binary responses.

         data("CoalMiners")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A 3-dimensional table of size 2 x 2 x 9 resulting from
      cross-tabulating variables for 18,282 coal miners. The variables
      and their levels are as follows:

      == ============== ===============================
      No Name           Levels
      1  Breathlessness B, NoB
      2  Wheeze         W, NoW
      3  Age            20-24, 25-29, 30-34, ..., 60-64
      == ============== ===============================

      In an earlier version of this data set, the first group, aged
      20-24, was inadvertently omitted from this data table and the
      breathlessness variable was called wheeze and vice versa.
