      The data comprises all games in the first German soccer league
      since its foundation in 1963. The data have been queried online
      from the official Web page of the DFB and prepared as a data frame
      in R by Daniel Dekic, Torsten Hothorn, and Achim Zeileis
      (replacing earlier versions of the data in the package containing
      only subsets of years).

      Each year/season comprises 34 rounds (except 1963, 1964, 1991) so
      that all 18 teams play twice against each other (switching home
      court advantage). In 1963/64, there were only 16 teams, hence only
      30 rounds. In 1991, after the German unification, there was one
      season with 20 teams and 38 rounds.
