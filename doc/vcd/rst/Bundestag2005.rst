      In the election for the German parliament “Bundestag”, five
      parties obtained enough votes to enter the parliament: the social
      democrats SPD, the conservative CDU/CSU, the liberal FDP, the
      green party “Die Gruenen” and the leftist party “Die Linke”. The
      table ``Bundestag2005`` gives the number of votes for each party
      (``Fraktion``) in each of the 16 German provinces
      (``Bundesland``). The provinces are ordered from North to South.

      The data have been obtained from the German statistical office
      (Statistisches Bundesamt) from the Web page given below.

      Note that the number of seats in the parliament cannot be computed
      from the number of votes alone. The examples below show the
      distribution of seats that resulted from the election.
