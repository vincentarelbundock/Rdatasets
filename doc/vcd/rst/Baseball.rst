      A data frame with 322 observations and 25 variables.

      name1
         player's first name.

      name2
         player's last name.

      atbat86
         times at Bat: number of official plate appearances by a hitter.
         It counts as an official at-bat as long as the batter does not
         walk, sacrifice, get hit by a pitch or reach base due to
         catcher's interference.

      hits86
         hits.

      homer86
         home runs.

      runs86
         the number of runs scored by a player. A run is scored by an
         offensive player who advances from batter to runner and touches
         first, second, third and home base in that order without being
         put out.

      rbi86
         Runs Batted In: A hitter earns a run batted in when he drives
         in a run via a hit, walk, sacrifice (bunt or fly) fielder's
         choice, hit-batsman or on an error (when the official scorer
         rules that the run would have scored anyway).

      walks86
         A “walk” (or “base on balls”) is an award of first base granted
         to a batter who receives four pitches outside the strike zone.
