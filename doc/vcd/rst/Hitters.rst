         :name: description

      This data set is deduced from the ``Baseball`` fielding data set:
      fielding performance basically includes the numbers of Errors,
      Putouts and Assists made by each player. In order to reduce the
      number of observations, the was compressed by calculating the mean
      number of errors, putouts and assists for each team and for only 6
      positions (1B, 2B, 3B, C, OF, SS and UT). In addition, each of
      these three variables was scaled to a common range by dividing
      each variable by the maximum of the variable.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data("Hitters")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 154 observations and 4 variables.

      Positions
         factor indicating the field position (1B=first baseman,
         2B=second baseman, 3B=third baseman, C=catcher, OF=outfielder,
         SS=Short Stop, UT=Utility Players).

      Putouts
         occur when a fielder causes an opposing player to be tagged or
         forced out.

      Assists
         are credited to other fielders involved in making that putout.

      Errors
         count the errors made by a player.
