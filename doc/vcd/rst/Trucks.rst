      .. rubric:: Truck Accidents Data
         :name: truck-accidents-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from a study in England in two periods from November 1969 to
      October 1971 and November 1971 to October 1973. A new compulsory
      safety measure for trucks was introduced in October 1971.
      Therefore, the question is whether the safety measure had an
      effect on the number of accidents and on the point of collision on
      the truck.
