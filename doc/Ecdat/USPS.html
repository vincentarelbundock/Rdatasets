<h2>
US Postal Service 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Numbers of post offices in the US from 1789 
to 2020 with their income and expenses in 
current dollars and proportion of the 
federal government and of Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP).  Also includes the number 
of pieces of mail, numbers of periodicals, 
pieces and periodicals per person, and 
cost coverage of periodicals for 
selected years.  
</p>
<p>It would be interesting to find the 
total value of the subsidies for 
newspapers and other periodicals as a 
proportion of the budgets of the USPS
and the federal government as well as
of GDP.  That is currently absent from 
the data consulted to produce this.  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(USPS)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> containing 232 
observations on the following variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Year</dt><dd> 
<p>integer: the year:  1789:2020 
</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Income, Expenses</dt><dd>
<p>Income and expenses in millions of current 
dollars, per Historian (2022).
</p>
</dd>    
<dt>Income_pFed, Expenses_pFed</dt><dd>
<p><code>Income</code> and <code>Expenses</code> as a 
proportion of 
<code>USGDPpresidents[, 'fedReceipts']</code> and
<code>USGDPpresidents[, 'fedOutlays']</code>, 
respectively.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Income_pGDP, Expenses_pGDP</dt><dd>
<p><code>Income</code> and <code>Expenses</code> as a 
proportion of <code>GDP</code>, per 
<code>MeasuringWorth</code>.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Income_cap, Expenses_cap</dt><dd>
<p><code>Income</code> and <code>Expenses</code> per 
capita in current dollars = 
<code>Income</code> and <code>Expenses</code> 
divided by 1000 * 
<code>USGDPpresidents[, 'population.K']</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>realIncome_cap, realExpenses_cap</dt><dd>
<p><code>Income</code> and <code>Expenses</code> per 
capita in constant 2012 dollars = 
<code>Income_cap</code> and 
<code>Expenses_cap</code> divided by 
<code>USGDPpresidents[, 'GDPdeflator']</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>postOffices</dt><dd>
<p>Number of post offices per Historian 
(2022).  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>KpopPerPostOffice</dt><dd>
<p>US population in thousands per post 
office:  
<code>USGDPpresidents[, 'population.K']</code> 
divided by <code>postOffices</code>.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>piecesOfMail, periodicals</dt><dd>
<p>numeric:  Millions of pieces of mail 
handled and periodicals mailed.  
&quot;Pieces of mail&quot;&quot; are from Historian 
(2022).  &quot;Periodicals&quot; are from 
Historian (2010).  
</p>
</dd> 
<dt>piecesOfMailPerCap, periodicalsPerCap</dt><dd>
<p><code>piecesOfMail</code> and <code>periodicals</code>  
handled per capita (per human in the US) 
per year.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>costCoveragePeriodicals</dt><dd>
<p>Cost coverage of periodicals, per 
Historian (2010).  This is available here 
only since 1960, though Historian (2010) 
gave a general outline of these numbers.  
This included saying, &quot;In 1966, the 
percentage of its own costs covered by 
second-class mail (or 'cost coverage'),
including the subsidy, was 35 percent 
[reported as 36 percent here].  Its real
coverage was 24 percent.&quot; The narrative 
noted that during parts of the nineteenth 
century the actual rate was zero.  
Sometimes it was zero only within county.  
Sometimes advertising was charged a higher 
rate than news.  
</p>
<p>Other than numbers for the period since 
1960, we note the coverage in 1951 as 20
percent, based on the following comment:
</p>
<p>&quot;In February 1951, in a special message to
Congress, President Harry S. Truman argued 
at length for a rate increase: 'In fiscal 
year 1952 . . . newspaper and magazine
publishers will have 200 million dollars 
&ndash; or 80 percent &ndash; of their postal costs 
paid for them by the general public.'&quot;

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols (2010) The Death and Life of American Journalism (Nation Books, pp. 310-311) describe how they computed 0.216 as an estimate of the percent of national income (Gross Domestic Product, GDP) devoted to newspaper subsidies, 1840-1844.  The numbers in the current dataset seem essentially equivalent but new and therefore perhaps more accurate.  With these numbers, we got 0.209 percent of GDP rather than their 0.216 percent.
