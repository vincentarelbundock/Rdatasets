<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Most of the contents of this dataset are 
easily defined and not controversial.  That's 
not true for the date upon which each country 
started its nuclear program, coded in 
<code>startNucPgm</code> and <code>startNucPgmYr</code>.  
The following summarizes the rationale behind 
the selection of the date for each country in 
this dataset.  
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>US</code>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan Project</a> started in
stages. It was officially brought to the
attention of the US government by a 
letter officially from 
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein-Roosevelt-letter.png">Albert Einstein to US President Roosevelt</a>, 1939-08-02.  
It was officially authorized 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Manhattan_Project">1942-01-19</a>. 
We use this later date as the date of the 
start of the US nuclear-weapons program.

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RU</code>
Russian scientists were studying uranium 
before the first world war but didn't get 
much official attention until the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima, 1945-08-06.  Shortly
thereafter on 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project">1945-08-22</a>, 
Stalin appointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavrentiy_Beria">Lavrentiy Beria</a>.  Beria 
was a able administrator and guided the 
project to fruition in four years.    

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>GB</code>
British scientists were among the leaders 
in nuclear technology in the late 
nineteenth century.  They welcomed 
German-Jewish physicists 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Robert_Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a>, who estimated 
in 1939 that only 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisch-Peierls_memorandum">a few pounds or kilograms of uranium-235 might be enough to achieve a critical mass, whereas several tonnes of natural uranium would likely be required</a>. 
Because of the war, this information was 
passed to scientists in the United States, 
who developed it into the bomb dropped on
Hiroshima 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki">1945-08-06</a>, 
with help from British and Canadian 
scientists and Canadian industry.  After 
the war, the US refused to share much of 
the information developed in the Manhattan
Project with the British.  British elites 
felt disrespected by US.  On 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_Kingdom#Resumption_of_independent_UK_efforts">1947-01-08</a>, 
the British government decided to 
initiate their own nuclear-weapons program.  

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>FR</code>
France was one of the nuclear pioneers, 
going back to the work of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Marie Curie</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Becquerel">Henri Becquerel</a> in the 
1890s.  In 1956 the French were deeply 
offended by the refusal of the US to 
support them in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>.  
On <a href="https://nuke.fas.org/guide/israel/nuke/farr.htm">France and Israel secretly agreed to
collaborate in the development of nuclear
weapons</a>.  

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CN</code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#History">Mao Zedong reportedly decided to begin a Chinese nuclear-weapons program</a> 
during the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Aftermath:_China_and_nuclear_weapons">First Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1954–1955</a>.  
That crisis was resolved shortly after
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Aftermath:_China_and_nuclear_weapons">1955-04-23</a>, 
when China stated it was willing to 
negotiate.  We use this as the date of the
start of China's nuclear weapons program.  

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>IN</code>
Indian scientists started research on 
nuclear weapons before Indian independence 
but didn't make a substantive commitment 
to actually making a nuclear weapon until 
they lost territory to China in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War">Sino-Indian War</a> 
that ended 1962-11-21.  We use that date as 
the date for the initiation of India's 
nuclear-weapons program.  

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>IL</code> 
Israel's first Prime Minister David 
Ben-Gurion was reportedly &quot;nearly obsessed&quot;
with obtaining nuclear weapons to prevent 
the Holocaust from recurring.  For present
purposes, we use 1949-03-10, the date of 
the end of the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab-Israeli_War">1948 Arab–Israeli War</a>, 
as the beginning of Israel's 
nuclear-weapons program.  

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>PK</code>
Pakistan's elite were totally humiliated 
by their defeat in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971">Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</a>,
1971-12-03 / -16: That war ended the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a>, 
by which Pakistan lost over half their population and 14 percent of their land area.   
Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto compared
Pakistan's surrender to the Treaty of
Versailles, which Germany was forced to sign 
in 1919. Bhutto observed 1972-01-20 that a
Pakistani scientist had been part of the
Manhattan Project, and Pakistani scientists
could do the same in Pakistan.  While
significant funding seemed not to have come
until later, 1972-01-20 is the date we will 
use here for the beginning of Pakistan's
nuclear-weapons program.  

</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>KP</code>
The 1950-1953 Korean War ended with a 
cease-fire, not an official end to 
hostilities.  Since then North Korea has
perceived nuclear threats from the US.  In 
1956 the Soviet Union began giving North 
Korean scientists and engineers &quot;basic
knowledge&quot; to help them initiate a 
nuclear program.  About 1962, 
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/18/these-5-things-help-make-sense-of-north-koreas-nuclear-tests-and-missile-launch/">North Korea committed itself to what it called &quot;all-fortressization&quot;</a>, 
which was the beginning of the 
hyper-militarized North Korea of today.  
North Korea reportedly asked the Soviet 
Union for help with a nuclear weapons 
program in 1963 and was turned down.  China
turned down similar requests in 1964 and 
1974.  Around 1980 North Korea began mining 
its own supplies of uranium and building 
its own factory to produce 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowcake">yellowcake</a>.  
(See also Bolton, 2012.)  For lack of 
something better, we use 1980-01-01 as the
start of North Korea's nuclear weapons 
program.  They clearly wanted nuclear 
weapons much earlier but didn't seem to 
move seriously in the direction of 
developing nuclear weapons until around
