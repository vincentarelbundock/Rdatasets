<h2>
US GDP per capita with presidents and wars
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It is commonly claimed that Franklin Roosevelt 
(FDR) did not end the Great Depression:  World 
War II (WW2) did.  This is supported by the 10.6
percent growth per year in real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita seen in the standard 
GDP estimates from 1940 to 1945.  It is also 
supported by the rapid decline in unemployment
during the war.  
</p>
<p>However, no comparable growth spurts in GDP per 
capita catch the eye in a plot of 
<code>log(GDP per capita)</code> from 1790 to 2015,
whether associated with a war or not, using data
from Measuring Worth.  The only other features 
of that plot that seem visually comparable are 
the economic disaster of Herbert Hoover's
presidency (when GDP per capital fell by 10 
percent per year, 1929-1932), the impressive 
growth of the US economy during the first seven
years of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency (6.4
percent per year, 1933-1940), and the post-World
War II recession (when GDP per capita fell by 
7.9 percent per year, 1945-1947).  (NOTE:  The 
web site for Measuring Worth, 
<code>https://measuringworth.com/</code> still works, 
but has not always been maintained to current
internet security standards.  Therefore, the 
link is provided here in text but not as a link.)
</p>
<p>Closer inspection of this plot suggests that the 
US economy has generally grown faster after FDR
than before.  This might plausibly be attributed 
to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">
&quot;The Keynesian Ascendancy 1939-1979&quot;</a>.  
</p>
<p>Unemployment dropped during the First World War 
as it did during WW2.  Comparable unemployment 
data are not available for the U.S. during other
major wars, most notably the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a> and the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican-American_War">Mexican-American War</a>.  
</p>
<p>This data set provides a platform for testing 
the effects of presidency, war, and Keynes.  It
does this by combining the numbers for US
population and real GDP per capital dollars from
Measuring Worth with the presidency and a list 
of major wars and an estimate of the battle
deaths by year per million population.  (As 
noted above, the web address for measuring worth, 
<code>https://measuringworth.com/</code>, often gives 
security warnings but still seems to provide the 
data as before.)

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(USGDPpresidents)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> containing 259 
observations on the following variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Year</dt><dd> 
<p>integer: the year, 
<code>c(seq(1610, 1770, 10), 1774:2015)</code>
</p>
</dd> 
<dt>CPI</dt><dd>
<p>Numeric:  U. S. Consumer Price Index per
Officer and Williamson (2022), starting in 
1774.  Average 1982-84 = 100.  
</p>
</dd>    
<dt>GDPdeflator</dt><dd>
<p>numeric:  Implicit price deflators for 
Gross Domestic Product with 2012 = 100 
per Johnston and Williamson.    
</p>
</dd>
<dt>population.K</dt><dd> 
<p>integer:  US population in thousands.  
</p>
<p>Population figures for 1610 to 1780 came 
from Springston (2013).  The rest came 
from Johnston and Williamson.  (The 
early population figures reflect only 
the European settlers in the British 
colonies that eventually became the 
US.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>realGDPperCapita</dt><dd>
<p>numeric:  real Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) per capita in 2012 dollars since 
1790.   
</p>
<p>Real <code>GDP</code> = 
<code>population.K*realGDPperCapita</code>,
in thousands.  
</p>
<p>Current or nominal <code>GDPperCapita</code> =
<code>realGDPperCapita*GDPdeflator/100</code>.
</p>
</dd> 
<dt>executive</dt><dd>
<p><code>ordered</code>:  Crown of England
through 1774, followed by the
<code>"ContinentalCongress"</code> and the 
<code>"ArticlesOfConfederation"</code> until
Washington, who became President under the
current base constitution in 1789.  Two
nineteenth century presidents are not 
listed here (William Henry Harrison and 
James A. Garfield), because they died so 
soon after inauguration that any 
contribution they made to the economic 
growth of the nation might seem too slight 
to measure accurately in annual data like 
this;  their contributions therefore 
appear combined with their replacements 
(John Tyler and Chester A. Arthur, 
respectively).  The service of two other 
presidents is officially combined here:  
&quot;Taylor-Fillmore&quot; refers to the 16 months
served by Zachary Taylor with the 32 months 
of Millard Fillmore.  These modifications 
make 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a>
number 41 on this list, even though he's 
the 44th president of the U.S.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>war</dt><dd>
<p><code>ordered</code>:  This lists the 
major wars in US history by years 
involving active hostilities.  A war is 
&quot;major&quot; for present purposes if it met 
two criteria:  
</p>
<p>(1) It averaged at least 10 battle deaths 
per year per million US population.  
</p>
<p>(2) It was listed in one of two lists of 
wars:  
For wars since 1816, it must have appeared 
in the 
<a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/">Correlates of 
War</a>.  For wars between 1790 and 1815, it 
must have appeared in the Wikipedia 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States">
&quot;List of wars involving the United States&quot;</a>.  
</p>
<p>The resulting list includes a few 
adjustments to the list of wars that might 
come readily to mind for people moderately
familiar with US history.    
</p>
<p>A traditional list might start with the
American Revolution, the War of 1812, the
Mexican-American war, the Civil War, the
Spanish-American war, World Wars I and II,
Korea, and Vietnam.  In addition, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War">
Northwest Indian War</a> involved very roughly 
30 battle deaths per year per million
population 1785-1795.  This compares with the
roughly 100 battle deaths per year 1812-1815
for the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812">
War of 1812</a>.  
</p>
<p>For present purposes, the Spanish-American 
War is combined with the lesser-known 
American-Philippine War:  The latter 
involved 50 percent more battle deaths but 
over a longer period of time and arguably 
with less impact on the stature of the US as 
a growing world power.  However, its 
magnitude suggest it might have impacted the 
US economy in a way roughly comparable to 
the Spanish-American war.  The two are
therefore listed here together as 
&quot;Spanish-American-Philippine&quot; war.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/">The Correlates of 
War (COW)</a> data include multiple US uses 
of military force  during the Vietnam War 
era.  It starts with &quot;Vietnam Phase 1&quot;, 
1961-65, with 506 battle deaths in the COW 
data base.  It includes the &quot;Second 
Laotian&quot; war phases 1 and 2, plus 
engagement with a &quot;Communist Coalition&quot; 
and Khmer Rouge as well as actions in the
Dominican Republic and Guatemala.  The 
current <code>data.frame</code> includes 
only &quot;Vietnam&quot;, referring primarily to 
COW's &quot;Vietnam War, Phase 2&quot;, 1965-1973.  
The associated battle deaths include 
battle deaths from these other, lesser
concurrent conflicts.  
</p>
<p>The COW data currently ends in 2007.  
However, the post-2000 conflicts in 
Afghanistan and Iraq averaged less than 
1,000 battle deaths per year or roughly 3
battle deaths per year per million population.
This is below the threshold of 10 battle 
deaths per year per million population.  
This in turn suggests that any impact of 
those conflicts on the US economy might be
small and difficult to estimate.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>battleDeaths</dt><dd>
<p>numeric:  Numbers of battle deaths by year
estimated by allocating to the different 
years the totals reported for each major war 
in proportion to the number of days 
officially in conflict each year.  The 
totals were obtained (in August-September 
2015) from 
<a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/">The 
Correlates of War</a> data for conflicts since
1816 and from Wikipedia for previous wars 
back to 1774, as noted above.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>battleDeathsPMP</dt><dd>
<p>numeric:  battle deaths per million

<p>Clearly, the more recent numbers should be

</p>
</dd>
<dt>fedReceipts, fedOutlays, fedSurplus</dt><dd>
<p>Receipts and Outlays of the US federal 
government in millions of current dollars.  
</p>
<p>For data beginning with 1901, these are 
from the US federal budget from The White 
House (2022).  Earlier data are from 
series Y 335-337 in US Census Bureau 
(1975).  As of 2022-02-22 the data from 
The White House included aggregations for 
1789-1849 and 1850-1900, which matched 
the totals of Y 335-337 for those two 
sets of years.  The numbers from 1901 to 
1933 are the same in both sources.  
</p>
<p>We used The White House (2022) for the more
recent numbers with one exception:  Between 
1976 and 1977 the fiscal year was changed 
from starting July 1 to October 1.  July, 
August, and September, 1976, is called the 
&quot;transitional quarter&quot;, and has been 
deleted from this dataset.  
</p>
<p>NOTES: 
</p>
<p>The numbers for 1843 are for only the 
first half of the year, January 1 through 
June 30.  This explains why the numbers for 
1843 are only roughly half of the 
corresponding values for 1844 and 1845.  
</p>
<p>Also, the numbers for 1791 are actually for 
1789-1791.  However, those numbers seem 
comparable to those for 1792 and 1793, so
it is listed as only for one year rather 
than three.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>fedDebt</dt><dd>
<p>US federal government debt in millions of 
current dollars per <code>FiscalData</code> (2022).  
This matches Y 338 in United States 
Census Bureau (1975) 1921-1939 but not 
earlier, and Y 338 ends with 1939.  
Between 1921 and 1939 these numbers are
as of June 30.  Between 1843 and 1920 
they are as of July 1.  The earlier 
numbers are as of January 1.  
</p>
<p><code>FiscalData</code> (2022) includes debt 
for both January 1 (20 million) and 
July 1 (33 million) for 1843.  For
present purposes, we omit the 
January 1 number.  This overstates
the volatility of the national 
debt during that period, showing 
it rising from 14 million in 
1842 (January 1) to 33 million 
in 1843 (July 1), being 18 not 
12 months.  The alternative would
be to delete the 33 million, but 
that would understate the volatility 
of the debt during that period. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>fedReceipts_pGDP, fedOutlays_pGDP, 
fedSurplus_pGDP, fedDebt_pGDP</dt><dd>
<p>numeric = <code>fedReceipts</code>, 
<code>fedOutlays</code>, <code>fedSurplus</code>, 
and <code>fedDebt</code> divided by 
<code>(population.K * realGPDperCapita / (GDPdeflator))</code>, 
except for the single year 1843, 
for which <code>fedReceipts</code>, 
<code>fedOutlays</code>, and <code>fedSurplus</code> 
were for only the first six months;  to 
compute <code>*_pGDP</code> for these numbers 
for 1843 only, the denominator in this 
formula is cut in half to compensate.
