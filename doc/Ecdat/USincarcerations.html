US incarcerations 1925 onward
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Counts of prisoners under the jurisdiction of 
state and federal correctional authorities in 
the US.  This does not include jail inmates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("USincarcerations")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 95 observations on the 
following 7 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>year</dt><dd>
<p>an integer vector giving the year 
<code>c(1925:2019)</code>.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>stateFedIncarcerees</dt><dd>
<p>Total number of incarcerees = 
<code>maleTotal + femaleTotal</code>. 
</p>
</dd>	
<dt>stateFedIncarcerationRate</dt><dd>
<p>incarceration rate = 
<code>stateFedIncarcerees</code> per 
100,000 population.  
</p>
</dd>	
<dt>stateFedMales</dt><dd>
<p>Total number of male incarcerees.  
</p>
</dd>	
<dt>stateFedMaleRate</dt><dd>
<p>male incarceration rate = 
<code>maleTotal</code> per 100,000 males 
in the US population.  
</p>
</dd>	
<dt>stateFedFemales</dt><dd>
<p>Total number of female incarcerees. 
</p>
</dd>	
<dt>stateFedFemaleRate</dt><dd>
<p>female incarceration rate = 
<code>femaleTotal</code> per 100,000 
females in the US population.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This dataset began as an effort to update 
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png">File:U.S. incarceration rates 1925 <code>onwards.png</code> on Wikimedia Commons</a>.  
Conveniently data on these variables 
was provided in a table for 1925 to 2014.  
And a description was given of how to update 
that table using files <code>p*t03.csv</code> and 
<code>p*t05.csv</code> from 
<a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2019">Prisoners In 2019</a>.
</p>
<p>An initial rationality check was to compute 
</p>
<p><code>checkTot</code> &lt;-
<code>stateFedIncarcerees</code> - 
<code>stateFedMales</code> - 
<code>stateFedFemales</code>
</p>
<p>This was 0 except for 1927 and 1973, when it 
was 637 and 684.  The <code>stateFedFemales</code> 
for 1972:1974 was 6269, 6004, 7389.  We 
replaced 6004 with 6688, which made the 
<code>checkTot</code> 0 for 1973.  
</p>
<p>Similar checks for 1927 yielded nothing as
obvious.  However, the
<code>stateFedIncarcerees</code> increased 6.9 
percent in 1926 over 1925, and 12.2 and 
5.8 percent in the following two years.  
Subtracting 637 from 109983 for 1927 gave us 
109346, which reduced the increase to 11.6 
percent for 1927.  It's no longer the maximum
annual increase prior to 1975.  
</p>
<p>Next, these numbers were compared with those
in <code>p19t03.csv</code> and <code>p19t05.csv</code>, 
which include  numbers of incarcerees and 
rates per 100,000 population for 2009:2019.  
The numbers were identical for 2009:2011, 
but there were several differences for the 
more recent counts.  
</p>
<p>For <code>USincarcerations</code>, we used the 
numbers from <code>p19t03.csv</code> and 
<code>p19t05.csv</code>, because they seem likely 
to be more accurate.  
</p>
<p>However, these numbers include only people 
in state and federal prisons.  It excludes
jails.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/data/key-statistics">Key Statistic: Total correctional population</a> 
includes a plot of &quot;Total adult 
correctional population 1980-2016&quot;, which
does include jails.  The data there are
available as
<code>Total_correctional_population_counts_by_status.csv</code>.  Data on these variables covering 
2008-2018 are available as 
<code>cpus1718.csv</code> from &quot;Data tables&quot; at 
<a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/correctional-populations-united-states-2017-2018">Publication Correctional Populations In The United States, 2017-2018</a>.  
The data in <code>cpus1718.csv</code> is mostly 
but not entirely identical to &quot;Total adult 
correctional population 1980-2016&quot; for 
2008-2016, the period of overlap.  We
therefore used the older data up to 2007
and <code>cpus1718.csv</code> for 2008-2018.  
</p>
<p>Actual analysis of the jail data is left
for another project.

<p>Data on jails and community supervision

</p>
<p>Some time in 2021 or later more recent data
should become available.  When that happens, 
it may be desired to update this table to
include those numbers &ndash; and check for any
revisions of earlier numbers.
