<h2> Files containing financial crisis data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>FinancialCrisisFiles</code> is an object of class
<code>financialCrisisFiles</code> created by the 
<code>financialCrisisFiles</code> function in 
<code>Ecfun</code>.  It describes files containing data 
on financial crises downloadable from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090824/http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7">https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090824/http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7</a>.
</p>
<p>NOTE:  When this dataset was created it was 
downloaded from <code>http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7</code>.  However, it was &quot;Not Found&quot; in testing on 2020-02-09.  Fortunately the data are still available on the Internet Archive.  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(FinancialCrisisFiles)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Reinhart and Rogoff (<a href="http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com">http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com</a>) provide
numerous data sets analyzed in their book, &quot;This Time Is Different:
Eight Centuries of Financial Folly&quot;.  Of interest here are data on
financial crises of various types for 70 countries spanning the years
1800 - 2010, downloadable from
<a href="http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7/">http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7/</a>.
</p>
<p>Version 0.2-3 of the <code>Ecfun</code> package 
included a function <code>financialCrisisFiles</code> 
that produced a list of class
<code>financialCrisisFiles</code> describing four
different Excel files in very similar formats 
with one sheet per Country and a few extra
descriptor sheets.  This data object
<code>FinancialCrisisFiles</code> was produced by 
that function.  That function required the 
<code>gdata</code> package, and users of that package
were advised to terminate use of it, because 
it was scheduled to be removed from CRAN along 
with all packages that used it. Since   Reinhart 
and Rogoff seemed not to be actively maintaining
that dataset, there seemed little need to do the 
work required to make the 
<code>Ecfun::financialCrisisFiles</code> work without 
<code>gdata</code>, so it was removed from <code>Ecfun</code>
version 2.0-4.  
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>FinancialCrisisFiles</code> is a list with
components carrying the names of files to be read. 
Each component is a list of optional arguments to
pass to <code>do.call(read.xls, ...)</code> to read the
sheet with name = name of that component.  (This
<code>read.xls</code> was part of the <code>gdata</code>
package, which may no longer be available on 
CRAN.) 
</p>
<p>This corresponds to the files downloaded from
<a href="http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7/">http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7/</a>
in January 2013 (except for the fourth, which was
not available there because of an error with the 
web site but instead was obtained directly from 
Prof. Reinhart).
