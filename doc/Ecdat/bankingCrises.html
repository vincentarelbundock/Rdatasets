<h2>
Countries in Banking Crises
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> identifying which of 70 
countries had a banking crisis each year 
1800:2010. The first column is <code>year</code>.  
The remaining columns carry the names of the
countries;  those columns are 1 for years 
with banking crises and 0 otherwise.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(bankingCrises)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p> A <code>data.frame</code> </p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This file was created using the following command:
</p>
<p><code>bankingCrises</code> &lt;- 
<code>readFinancialCrisisFiles(FinancialCrisisFiles)</code>
</p>
<p>HOWEVER:  This function was in <code>Ecfun</code> 0.2-3 
but was removed in 0.2-4.  It used 
<code>gdata::read.xls</code>, and <code>gdata</code>
users were informed that <code>gdata</code> might be 
removed from CRAN, and any package that used it
would also be removed.  It seemed that the 
database that this function was designed to read
may not have been updated, which suggested that 
it made sense to remove this function, 
because it there may not be any further need 
for it.  
</p>
<p>This dataset is an update of a subset of the 
data used to create Figure 10.1.  Capital 
Mobility and the Incidence of Banking Crises, 
All Countries, 1800-2008, Reinhart and Rogoff 
(2009, p. 156).
</p>
<p>The general upward trend visible in a plot of 
these data may be attributed to at least two
different factors:  
</p>
<p>(1) The gradual increase in the proportion of 
human labor that is monetized.  
</p>
<p>(2) An increase in the general ability of cronies 
of those in power to gamble with other people's
money in forming and bankrupting financial
institutions.  The marked feature of this plot is
the virtual absence of banking crises during the
period of the Bretton Woods agreement, 1944 to 
1971.  This period ended when US President Nixon 
in effect canceled the Bretton Woods agreement by
taking the US off the silver standard.
