      Counts of prisoners under the jurisdiction of state and federal
      correctional authorities in the US. This does not include jail
      inmates.

      A data frame with 95 observations on the following 7 variables.

      year
         an integer vector giving the year ``c(1925:2019)``.

      stateFedIncarcerees
         Total number of incarcerees = ``maleTotal + femaleTotal``.

      stateFedIncarcerationRate
         incarceration rate = ``stateFedIncarcerees`` per 100,000
         population.

      stateFedMales
         Total number of male incarcerees.

      stateFedMaleRate
         male incarceration rate = ``maleTotal`` per 100,000 males in
         the US population.

      stateFedFemales
         Total number of female incarcerees.

      stateFedFemaleRate
         female incarceration rate = ``femaleTotal`` per 100,000 females
         in the US population.

      This dataset began as an effort to update `File:U.S. incarceration
      rates 1925 ``onwards.png`` on Wikimedia
      Commons <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png>`__.
      Conveniently data on these variables was provided in a table for
      1925 to 2014. And a description was given of how to update that
      table using files ``p*t03.csv`` and ``p*t05.csv`` from `Prisoners
      In
      2019 <https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2019>`__.

      An initial rationality check was to compute

      ``checkTot`` <- ``stateFedIncarcerees`` - ``stateFedMales`` -
      ``stateFedFemales``

      This was 0 except for 1927 and 1973, when it was 637 and 684. The
      ``stateFedFemales`` for 1972:1974 was 6269, 6004, 7389. We
      replaced 6004 with 6688, which made the ``checkTot`` 0 for 1973.

      Similar checks for 1927 yielded nothing as obvious. However, the
      ``stateFedIncarcerees`` increased 6.9 percent in 1926 over 1925,
      and 12.2 and 5.8 percent in the following two years. Subtracting
      637 from 109983 for 1927 gave us 109346, which reduced the
      increase to 11.6 percent for 1927. It's no longer the maximum
      annual increase prior to 1975.

      Next, these numbers were compared with those in ``p19t03.csv`` and
      ``p19t05.csv``, which include numbers of incarcerees and rates per
      100,000 population for 2009:2019. The numbers were identical for
      2009:2011, but there were several differences for the more recent
      counts.

      For ``USincarcerations``, we used the numbers from ``p19t03.csv``
      and ``p19t05.csv``, because they seem likely to be more accurate.

      However, these numbers include only people in state and federal
      prisons. It excludes jails.

      `Key Statistic: Total correctional
      population <https://bjs.ojp.gov/data/key-statistics>`__ includes a
      plot of "Total adult correctional population 1980-2016", which
      does include jails. The data there are available as
      ``Total_correctional_population_counts_by_status.csv``. Data on
      these variables covering 2008-2018 are available as
      ``cpus1718.csv`` from "Data tables" at `Publication Correctional
      Populations In The United States,
      2017-2018 <https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/correctional-populations-united-states-2017-2018>`__.
      The data in ``cpus1718.csv`` is mostly but not entirely identical
      to "Total adult correctional population 1980-2016" for 2008-2016,
      the period of overlap. We therefore used the older data up to 2007
      and ``cpus1718.csv`` for 2008-2018.

      Actual analysis of the jail data is left for another project.

      The primary source for the more recent data are files

      Data on jails and community supervision dating back to 1980 are
      available in `Key Statistic: Total correctional
      population <https://bjs.ojp.gov/data/key-statistics>`__ with data
      on the most recent years available from `Publication Correctional
      Populations In The United States,
      2017-2018 <https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/correctional-populations-united-states-2017-2018>`__.

      Some time in 2021 or later more recent data should become
      available. When that happens, it may be desired to update this
      table to include those numbers â€“ and check for any revisions of
      earlier numbers.
