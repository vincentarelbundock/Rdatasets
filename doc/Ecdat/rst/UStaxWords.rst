         :name: number-of-words-in-us-tax-law

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Thousands of words in US tax law for 1995 to 2015 in 10 year
      intervals. This includes income taxes and all taxes in the code
      itself (written by congress) and regulations (written by
      government administrators). For 2015 only ``EntireTaxCodeAndRegs``
      is given; for other years, this number is broken down by income
      tax vs. other taxes and code vs. regulations.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Thousands of words in the US tax code and federal tax regulations,
      1955-2015. This is based on data from the Tax Foundation
      (``taxfoundation.org``), adjusted to eliminate an obvious
      questionable observation in ``otherTaxRegulations`` for 1965. The
      numbers of words in ``otherTaxRegulations`` was not reported
      directly by the Tax Foundation but is easily computed as the
      difference between their Income and Entire tax numbers. This
      series shows the numbers falling by 48 percent between 1965 and
      1975 and by 1.5 percent between 1995 and 2005. These are the only
      declines seen in these numbers and seem inconsistent with the
      common concern (expressed e.g., in Moody, Warcholik and Hodge,
      2005) about the difficulties of simplifying any governmental
      program, because vested interest appear to defend almost anything.
      Lessig (2011) notes that virtually all provisions of US law that
      favor certain segments of society are set to expire after a modest
      number of years. These sunset provisions provide recurring
      opportunities for incumbent politicians to extort campaign
      contributions from those same segments to ensure the continuation
      of the favorable treatment.

      The decline of 48 percent in ``otherTaxRegulations`` seems more
      curious for two additional reasons: First, it was preceded by a
      tripling of ``otherTaxRegulations`` between 1955 and 1965. Second,
      it was NOT accompanied by any comparable behavior of
      ``otherTaxCode``. Instead, the latter grew each decade by between
      17 and 53 percent, similar to but slower than the growth in
      ``IncomeTaxCode`` and ``IncomeTaxRegulations``.

      Accordingly, ``otherTaxRegulations`` for 1965 is replaced by the
      average of the numbers for 1955 and 1975, and
      ``EntireTaxRegulations`` for 1965 is comparably adjusted. This
      replaces (1322, 2960) for those two variables for 1965 with (565,
      2203). In addition, ``otherTaxCodeAndRegs`` and
      ``EntireTaxCodeAndRegulations`` are also changed from (1626, 3507)
      to (870, 2751).

      Independent of whether this adjustment is correct or not, it's
      clear that there have been roughly 3 words of regulations for each
      word in the tax code. Most of these are income tax regulations,
      which have recently contained 4.5 words for every word in code.
      The income tax code currently includes roughly 50 percent more
      words than other tax code.
