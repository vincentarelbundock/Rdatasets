         :name: description

      Data on classification activity of the United States government.

      Fitzpatrick (2013) notes that the dramatic jump in derivative
      classification activity (``DerivClassActivity``) that occurred in
      2009 coincided with "New guidance issued to include electronic
      environment". Apart from the jump in 2009, the
      ``DerivClassActivity`` tended to increase by roughly 12 percent
      per year (with a standard deviation of the increase in the natural
      logarithm of ``DerivClassActivity`` of 0.18).

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A dataframe containing :

      year
         the calendar year

      OCAuthority
         Number of people in the government designated as Original
         Classification Authorities for the indicated ``year``.

      OCActivity
         Original classification activity for the indicated year: These
         are the number of documents created with an original
         classification, i.e., so designated by an official Original
         Classification Authority.

      TenYearDeclass
         Percent of ``OCActivity`` covered by the 10 year
         declassification rules.

      DerivClassActivity
         Derivative classification activity for the indicated year:
         These are the number of documents created that claim another
         document as the authority for classification.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The lag 1 autocorrelation of the first difference of the
      logarithms of ``DerivClassActivity`` through 2008 is ``-0.52``.
      However, because there are only 13 numbers (12 differences), this
      negative correlation is not statistically significant.
