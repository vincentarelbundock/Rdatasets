      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Numbers of post offices in the US from 1789 to 2020 with their
      income and expenses in current dollars and proportion of the
      federal government and of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Also
      includes the number of pieces of mail, numbers of periodicals,
      pieces and periodicals per person, and cost coverage of
      periodicals for selected years.

      It would be interesting to find the total value of the subsidies
      for newspapers and other periodicals as a proportion of the
      budgets of the USPS and the federal government as well as of GDP.
      That is currently absent from the data consulted to produce this.

      A ``data.frame`` containing 232 observations on the following
      variables:

      Year
         integer: the year: 1789:2020

      Income, Expenses
         Income and expenses in millions of current dollars, per
         Historian (2022).

      Income_pFed, Expenses_pFed
         ``Income`` and ``Expenses`` as a proportion of
         ``USGDPpresidents[, 'fedReceipts']`` and
         ``USGDPpresidents[, 'fedOutlays']``, respectively.

      Income_pGDP, Expenses_pGDP
         ``Income`` and ``Expenses`` as a proportion of ``GDP``, per
         ``MeasuringWorth``.

      Income_cap, Expenses_cap
         ``Income`` and ``Expenses`` per capita in current dollars =
         ``Income`` and ``Expenses`` divided by 1000 \*
         ``USGDPpresidents[, 'population.K']``.

      realIncome_cap, realExpenses_cap
         ``Income`` and ``Expenses`` per capita in constant 2012 dollars
         = ``Income_cap`` and ``Expenses_cap`` divided by
         ``USGDPpresidents[, 'GDPdeflator']``.

      postOffices
         Number of post offices per Historian (2022).

      KpopPerPostOffice
         US population in thousands per post office:
         ``USGDPpresidents[, 'population.K']`` divided by
         ``postOffices``.

      piecesOfMail, periodicals
         numeric: Millions of pieces of mail handled and periodicals
         mailed. "Pieces of mail"" are from Historian (2022).
         "Periodicals" are from Historian (2010).

      piecesOfMailPerCap, periodicalsPerCap
         ``piecesOfMail`` and ``periodicals`` handled per capita (per
         human in the US) per year.

      costCoveragePeriodicals
         Cost coverage of periodicals, per Historian (2010). This is
         available here only since 1960, though Historian (2010) gave a
         general outline of these numbers. This included saying, "In
         1966, the percentage of its own costs covered by second-class
         mail (or 'cost coverage'), including the subsidy, was 35
         percent [reported as 36 percent here]. Its real coverage was 24
         percent." The narrative noted that during parts of the
         nineteenth century the actual rate was zero. Sometimes it was
         zero only within county. Sometimes advertising was charged a
         higher rate than news.

         Other than numbers for the period since 1960, we note the
         coverage in 1951 as 20 percent, based on the following comment:

         "In February 1951, in a special message to Congress, President
         Harry S. Truman argued at length for a rate increase: 'In
         fiscal year 1952 . . . newspaper and magazine publishers will
         have 200 million dollars – or 80 percent – of their postal
         costs paid for them by the general public.'"

      percent of GDP between 1840 and 1844.

      Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols (2010) The Death and Life of
      American Journalism (Nation Books, pp. 310-311) describe how they
      computed 0.216 as an estimate of the percent of national income
      (Gross Domestic Product, GDP) devoted to newspaper subsidies,
      1840-1844. The numbers in the current dataset seem essentially
      equivalent but new and therefore perhaps more accurate. With these
      numbers, we got 0.209 percent of GDP rather than their 0.216
      percent.
