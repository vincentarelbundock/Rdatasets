      .. rubric:: Countries in Banking Crises
         :name: countries-in-banking-crises

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A ``data.frame`` identifying which of 70 countries had a banking
      crisis each year 1800:2010. The first column is ``year``. The
      remaining columns carry the names of the countries; those columns
      are 1 for years with banking crises and 0 otherwise.

         data(bankingCrises)

      A ``data.frame``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This file was created using the following command:

      ``bankingCrises`` <-
      ``readFinancialCrisisFiles(FinancialCrisisFiles)``

      HOWEVER: This function was in ``Ecfun`` 0.2-3 but was removed in
      0.2-4. It used ``gdata::read.xls``, and ``gdata`` users were
      informed that ``gdata`` might be removed from CRAN, and any
      package that used it would also be removed. It seemed that the
      database that this function was designed to read may not have been
      updated, which suggested that it made sense to remove this
      function, because it there may not be any further need for it.

      This dataset is an update of a subset of the data used to create
      Figure 10.1. Capital Mobility and the Incidence of Banking Crises,
      All Countries, 1800-2008, Reinhart and Rogoff (2009, p. 156).

      The general upward trend visible in a plot of these data may be
      attributed to at least two different factors:

      (1) The gradual increase in the proportion of human labor that is
      monetized.

      (2) An increase in the general ability of cronies of those in
      power to gamble with other people's money in forming and
      bankrupting financial institutions. The marked feature of this
      plot is the virtual absence of banking crises during the period of
      the Bretton Woods agreement, 1944 to 1971. This period ended when
      US President Nixon in effect canceled the Bretton Woods agreement
      by taking the US off the silver standard.
