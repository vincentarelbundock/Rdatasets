      These data seem to have come from the same source as
      ``carData::Mroz``, though each data set has variables not in the
      other. The variables that are shared have different names.

      On 2019-11-04 Bruno Rodrigues explained that
      ``Ecdat::Mroz['work']`` had the two labels incorrectly swapped,
      and ``wooldridge::mroz['inlf']`` was correct; ``wooldridge``
      matches ``carData::Mroz['lfp']``.
