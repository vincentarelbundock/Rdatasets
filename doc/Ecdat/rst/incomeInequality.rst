      .. rubric:: Income Inequality in the US
         :name: income-inequality-in-the-us

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data on quantiles of the distributions of family incomes in the
      United States. This combines three data sources:

      (1) US Census Table F-1 for the central quantiles

      (2) Piketty and Saez for the 95th and higher quantiles

      (3) Gross Domestic Product and implicit price deflators from
      Measuring Worth. (NOTE: The Measuring Worth Web site,
      ``https://MeasuringWorth.com``, often gives security warnings. The
      desired data still seems to be available and not corrupted,
      however.)

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(incomeInequality)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A ``data.frame`` containing:

      Year
         numeric year 1947:2012

      Number.thousands
         number of families in the US

      quintile1, quintile2, median, quintile3, quintile4, p95
         quintile1, quintile2, quintile3, quintile4, and p95 are the
         indicated quantiles of the distribution of family income from
         US Census Table F-1. The media is computed as the geometric
         mean of quintile2 and quintile3. This is accurate to the extent
         that the lognormal distribution adequately approximates the
         central 20 percent of the income distribution, which it should
         for most practical purposes.

      P90, P95, P99, P99.5, P99.9, P99.99
         The indicated quantiles of family income per Piketty and Saez

      realGDP.M, GDP.Deflator, PopulationK, realGDPperCap
         real GDP in millions, GDP implicit price deflators, US
         population in thousands, and real GDP per capita, according to
         ``MeasuringWorth.com``. (NOTE: The web address for this,
         ``https://MeasuringWorth.com``, seems to be functional but may
         not be maintained to current internet security standards. It is
         therefore given here as text rather than a hot link.)

      P95IRSvsCensus
         ratio of the estimates of the 95th percentile of distributions
         of family income from the Piketty and Saez analysis of data
         from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and from the US Census
         Bureau.

         The IRS has ranged between 72 and 98 percent of the Census
         Bureau figures for the 95th percentile of the distribution,
         with this ratio averaging around 75 percent since the late
         1980s. However, this systematic bias is modest relative to the
         differences between the different quantiles of interest in this
         combined dataset.

      personsPerFamily
         average number of persons per family using the number of
         families from US Census Table F-1 and the population from
         MeasuringWorth. (Note: The web site for Measuring Worth,
         ``https://MeasuringWorth.com``, often gives security warnings.
         It still seems to work. It seems that the web site is not
         maintained to current internet security standards.)

      realGDPperFamily
         ``personsPerFamily * realGDPperCap``

      mean.median
         ratio of ``realGDPperFamily`` to the median. This is a measure
         of skewness and income inequality.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      For details on how this ``data.frame`` was created, see
      ``"F1.PikettySaez.R"`` in
      ``system.file('scripts', package='fda')``. This provides links for
      files to download and R commands to read those files and convert
      them into an updated version of ``incomeInequality``. This is a
      reasonable thing to do if it is more than 2 years since
      ``max(incomeInequality$year)``. All data are in constant 2012
      dollars.
