      This is extracted from Table 6.16 of the National Income and
      Product Accounts (NIPA) compiled by the Bureau of Economic
      Analysis of the United States federal government. This table comes
      in four parts, A (1929-1947), B (1948-1987), C (1987-2000), and D
      (1998-present). Parts A, B, C and D contain different numbers of
      data elements, but the first five have the same names and are the
      only ones used here. The overlap between parts C and D (1998-2000)
      have a root mean square relative difference of 0.7 percent; there
      were no differences between the numbers in the overlap period
      between parts B and C (1987).

      This was created using the following command:

      ``demoDir <- system.file('demoFiles', package='Ecdat')``
      ``demoCsv <- dir(demoDir, pattern='csv$', full.names=TRUE)``

      ``nipa6.16 <- readNIPA(demoCsv)``
      ``USFinanceIndustry <- as.data.frame(nipa6.16)``
      ``names(USFinanceIndustry) <- c('year',      'CorporateProfitsAdj', 'Domestic', 'Financial',      'Nonfinancial', 'restOfWorld')``
      ``USFinanceIndustry$FinanceProportion <-      with(USFinanceIndustry, Financial/Domestic)``

      last three are available in annual and quarterly summaries. The
      ``USFinanceIndustry`` data combined the first 4 rows of the 4
      annual summary tables.
