      Proportion of the US population in each of the 283 ``OCC1950``
      occupation codes for each year in the `Integrated Public Use
      Microdata Series (IPUMS) - US
      database <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPUMS>`__.

      A ``matrix`` with one row for each of 281 OCC1950 occupation codes
      in IPUMS-US and one column for each year in their dataset as of
      2020-03-17, being ``c(1850:1880, 1900:2000, 2001:2016)``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This dataset was created using the code in the IPUMS vignette in
      the ``Ecfun`` package using
      ``tapply(HHWT, IPUMSdata[c("OCC1950", "YEAR")], sum)``, then
      normalizing so the total for each year was 1.

      In fact a plot of the sums for each year of ``HHWT`` were close to
      the ``USGDPpresidents$population.K*1000`` except for 1970, when
      they were double.

      Universe Note from the IPUMS documentation for their variable
      ``OCC1950``: "New Workers" are persons seeking employment for the
      first time, who had not yet secured their first job.

      OCC1950 applies the 1950 Census Bureau occupational classification
      system to occupational data, to enhance comparability across
      years. For pre-1940 samples created at the University of
      Minnesota, the alphabetic responses supplied by enumerators were
      directly coded into the 1950 classification. For other samples,
      the information in the variable OCC was recoded into the 1950
      classification. Codes above 970 are non-occupational responses
      retained in the historical census samples or blank/unknown. The
      design of OCC1950 is described at length in "Integrated Occupation
      and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the
      IPUMS.". The composition of the 1950 occupation categories is
      described in detail in U.S. Bureau of the Census, Alphabetic Index
      of Occupations and Industries: 1950 (Washington D.C., 1950).

      In 1850-1880, any laborer with no specified industry in a
      household with a farmer is recoded into farm labor. In 1860-1900,
      any woman with an occupational response of "housekeeper" enters
      the non-occupational category "keeping house" if she is related to
      the head of household. Cases affected by these imputation
      procedures are identified by an appropriate data quality flag
      (present in the raw IPUMS data but ignored for this summary).

      A parallel variable called OCC1990, available for the samples from
      1950 onward, codes occupations into a simplified version of the
      1990 occupational coding scheme." [OCC1990 was ignored for the
      present purposes, because it is not coded for data prior to 1950.]

      NOTE: In the 2020-03-17 extraction, there were 283 OCC1950 codes
      documented, but only 291 of them were actually in the data I got.
      The codes for "Not yet classified" and "New Workers" were not
      used.
