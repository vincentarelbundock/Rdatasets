      ``data.frame`` of cyber security breaches involving health care
      records of 500 or more humans reported to the U.S. Department of
      Health and Human Services (HHS) as of June 27, 2014.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A ``data.frame`` with 1055 observations on the following 24
      variables:

      Number
         integer record number in the HHS data base

      Name_of_Covered_Entity
         ``factor`` giving the name of the entity experiencing the
         breach

      State
         Factor giving the 2-letter code of the state where the breach
         occurred. This has 52 levels for the 50 states plus the
         District of Columbia (DC) and Puerto Rico (PR).

      Business_Associate_Involved
         Factor giving the name of a subcontractor (or blank) associated
         with the breach.

      Individuals_Affected
         ``integer`` number of humans whose records were compromised in
         the breach. This is 500 or greater; U.S. law requires reports
         of breaches involving 500 or more records but not of breaches
         involving fewer.

      Date_of_Breach
         ``character`` vector giving the date or date range of the
         breach. Recodes as ``Date``\ s in ``breach_start`` and
         ``breach_end``.

      Type_of_Breach
         ``factor`` with 29 levels giving the type of breach (e.g.,
         "Theft" vs. "Unauthorized Access/Disclosure", etc.)

      Location_of_Breached_Information
         ``factor`` with 41 levels coding the location from which the
         breach occurred (e.g., "Paper", "Laptop", etc.)

      Date_Posted_or_Updated
         ``Date`` the information was posted to the HHS data base or
         last updated.

      Summary
         ``character`` vector of a summary of the incident.

      breach_start
         ``Date`` of the start of the incident = first date given in
         ``Date_of_Breach`` above.

      ``breach_end`` ``Date`` of the end of the incident or ``NA`` if
      only one date is given in ``Date_of_Breach`` above. ``year``
      ``integer`` giving the year of the breach

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data primarily consists of breaches that occurred from 2010
      through early 2014 when the extract was taken. However, a few
      breaches are recorded including 1 from 1997, 8 from 2002-2007, 13
      from 2008 and 56 from 2009. The numbers of breaches from 2010 -
      2014 are 211, 229, 227, 254 and 56, respectively. (A chi-square
      test for equality of the counts from 2010 through 2013 is 4.11,
      which with 3 degrees of freedom has a significance probability of
      0.25. Thus, even though the lowest number is the first and the
      largest count is the last, the apparent trend is not statistically
      significant under the usual assumption of independent Poisson
      trials.)
