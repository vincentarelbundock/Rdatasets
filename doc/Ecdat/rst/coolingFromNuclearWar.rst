      .. rubric:: Global cooling from a nuclear war
         :name: global-cooling-from-a-nuclear-war

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Average surface temperature changes world wide and in the Northern
      Hemisphere 3 and 10 years after the injections of 5, 50 and 150 Tg
      (teragrams = millions of metric tons) of smoke into the upper
      troposphere, per Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007).

      These numbers are relative to the average for 1925-1975, which
      explains why the numbers are positive with smoke = 0.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A dataframe containing :

      smoke
         teragrams = millions of metric tons

      dC3g, dC10g, dC3n, dC10n
         average change in surface temperature 3 and 10 years after
         injection of ``smoke`` into the upper troposphere globally
         (``g``) or in the Northern Hemisphere (``n``) in degrees
         Celsius.
