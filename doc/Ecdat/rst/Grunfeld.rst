      There are several versions of these data.

      ``GrunfeldGreene`` is "A data frame containing 20 annual
      observations on 3 variables for 5 firms." That dataset reportedly
      contains errors but is maintained in that way to avoid breaking
      the code of others who use it. That help file also provides a link
      to the corrected version.
