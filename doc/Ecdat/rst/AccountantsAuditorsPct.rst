      Accountants and auditors as a percent of the US labor force 1850
      to 2016 updating the analysis in Wyatt and Hecker (2006).

      a numeric vector of length 30 giving the percent of the US labor
      force in "Accounting and Auditing" each decade from 1850 to 2010
      except for 1940 plus each year between 2011 and 2016.

      This is based primarily on data extracted from the `Integrated
      Public Use Microdata
      Series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPUMS>`__ on 2018-09-01 with
      the computations documented in a vignette by this title in the
      ``Ecfun`` package.

      This updates the data on Accountants and Auditors in Wyatt and
      Hecker (2006). They relied primarily on data extracted from the
      `Integrated Public Use Microdata
      Series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPUMS>`__. This follows the
      same methodology with two modifications:

      1. IPUMS provided no data for 1940. Wyatt and Hecker (2006) used
      `Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to
      1970, Bicentennial Edition, part 1 (U.S. Department of Commerce,
      Bureau of the Census,
      1975) <https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1975/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1970.html>`__
      for 1910-1940. The current data set uses that source only for
      1040.

      2. The IPUMS numbers showed an extreme jump from 1850 to 1860
      followed by an even more extreme drop to 1870. The numbers in
      Sobek (2006) showed essentially the same behavior. Specifically,
      Sobek (2006) estimated the number of accountants and auditors in
      the US in those three years as 700, 1700, and 1200, and the labor
      force as 5277000, 8160800, and 12004200. These numbers give
      accountants and auditors as 0.013, 0.021, and 0.010 percent of the
      labor force, respectively for those three years. These numbers
      portray an incredible increase in the employment of accountants
      and auditors between 1850 and 1860 followed by a shocking decline
      the following decade. If, however, we swap the 1700 and 1200
      between 1860 and 1870, the percentages become quite stable: 0.013,
      0.015, and 0.014 percent, respectively.

      We use these latter numbers, even though the uncorrected numbers
      seem more consistent with the numbers obtained from IPUMS.
