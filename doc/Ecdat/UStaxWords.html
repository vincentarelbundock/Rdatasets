<h2> Number of Words in US Tax Law</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Thousands of words in US tax law for 1995
to 2015 in 10 year intervals.  This
includes income taxes and all taxes in the
code itself (written by congress) and
regulations (written by government 
administrators).  For 2015 only 
<code>EntireTaxCodeAndRegs</code> is given;  for 
other years, this number is broken down by 
income tax vs. other taxes and code vs. 
regulations.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Thousands of words in the US tax code and 
federal tax regulations, 1955-2015.  This
is based on data from the Tax Foundation
(<code>taxfoundation.org</code>), adjusted to 
eliminate an obvious questionable observation 
in <code>otherTaxRegulations</code> for 1965.  The
numbers of words in 
<code>otherTaxRegulations</code> was not reported
directly by the Tax Foundation but is
easily computed as the difference between
their Income and Entire tax numbers.  This
series  shows the numbers falling by 48
percent between 1965 and 1975 and by 1.5
percent between 1995 and 2005.  These are
the only declines seen in these numbers
and seem inconsistent with the common 
concern (expressed e.g., in Moody,
Warcholik and Hodge, 2005) about the
difficulties of simplifying any 
governmental program, because vested 
interest appear to defend almost anything.
Lessig (2011) notes that virtually all
provisions of US law that favor certain
segments of society are set to expire after
a modest number of years.  These sunset
provisions provide recurring opportunities
for incumbent politicians to extort 
campaign contributions from those same
segments to ensure the continuation of the
favorable treatment.  
</p>
<p>The decline of 48 percent in 
<code>otherTaxRegulations</code> seems more 
curious for two additional reasons:  First,
it was preceded by a tripling of 
<code>otherTaxRegulations</code> between 1955 and
1965.  Second, it was NOT accompanied by
any comparable behavior of 
<code>otherTaxCode</code>. Instead, the latter 
grew each decade by between 17 and 53
percent, similar to but slower than the
growth in <code>IncomeTaxCode</code> and 
<code>IncomeTaxRegulations</code>.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, <code>otherTaxRegulations</code> for
1965 is replaced by the average of the
numbers for 1955 and 1975, and 
<code>EntireTaxRegulations</code> for 1965 is
comparably adjusted.  This replaces (1322,
2960) for those two variables for 1965
with (565, 2203).  In addition, 
<code>otherTaxCodeAndRegs</code> and
<code>EntireTaxCodeAndRegulations</code> are also
changed from (1626, 3507) to (870, 2751).
</p>
<p>Independent of whether this adjustment is 
correct or not, it's clear that there have
been roughly 3 words of regulations for
each word in the tax code.  Most of these
are income tax regulations, which have
recently contained 4.5 words for every
word in code. The income tax code currently
includes roughly 50 percent more words than
other tax code.
