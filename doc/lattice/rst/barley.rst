      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 120 observations on the following 4 variables.

      yield
         Yield (averaged across three blocks) in bushels/acre.

      variety
         Factor with levels ``"Svansota"``, ``"No. 462"``,
         ``"Manchuria"``, ``"No. 475"``, ``"Velvet"``, ``"Peatland"``,
         ``"Glabron"``, ``"No. 457"``, ``"Wisconsin No. 38"``,
         ``"Trebi"``.

      year
         Factor with levels ``1932``, ``1931``

      site
         Factor with 6 levels: ``"Grand Rapids"``, ``"Duluth"``,
         ``"University Farm"``, ``"Morris"``, ``"Crookston"``,
         ``"Waseca"``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      These data are yields in bushels per acre, of 10 varieties of
      barley grown in 1/40 acre plots at University Farm, St. Paul, and
      at the five branch experiment stations located at Waseca, Morris,
      Crookston, Grand Rapids, and Duluth (all in Minnesota). The
      varieties were grown in three randomized blocks at each of the six
      stations during 1931 and 1932, different land being used each year
      of the test.

      Immer et al. (1934) present the data for each
      Year*Site*Variety*Block. The data here is the average yield across
      the three blocks.

      Immer et al. (1934) refer (once) to the experiment as being
      conducted in 1930 and 1931, then later refer to it (repeatedly) as
      being conducted in 1931 and 1932. Later authors have continued the
      confusion.

      Cleveland (1993) suggests that the data for the Morris site may
      have had the years switched.
