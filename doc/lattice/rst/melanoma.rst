      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry present
      age-adjusted numbers of melanoma skin-cancer incidences per
      100,000 people in Connectict for the years from 1936 to 1972.

      .. rubric:: Usage

      A data frame with 37 observations on the following 2 variables.

      year
         Years 1936 to 1972.

      incidence
         Rate of melanoma cancer per 100,000 population.

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      This dataset is not related to the ``melanoma`` dataset in the
      **boot** package with the same name.

      The S-PLUS 6.2 help for the melanoma data says that the incidence
      rate is per *million*, but this is not consistent with data found
      at the National Cancer Institute (https://www.cancer.gov/).
