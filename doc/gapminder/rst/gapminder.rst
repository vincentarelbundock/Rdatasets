      The main data frame ``gapminder`` has 1704 rows and 6 variables:

      country
         factor with 142 levels

      continent
         factor with 5 levels

      year
         ranges from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years

      lifeExp
         life expectancy at birth, in years

      pop
         population

      gdpPercap
         GDP per capita (US$, inflation-adjusted)

      The supplemental data frame ``gapminder_unfiltered`` was not
      filtered on ``year`` or for complete data and has 3313 rows.
