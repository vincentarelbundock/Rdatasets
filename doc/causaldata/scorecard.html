<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data is not just limited to four-year colleges and includes a very wide variety of institutions.
</p>
<p>Note that the labor market (earnings, working) and repayment rate data do not refer to the same cohort of students, but rather are matched on the year in which outcomes are recorded. Labor market data refers to cohorts beginning college as undergraduates ten years prior, repayment rate data refers to cohorts entering repayment seven years prior.
</p>
<p>Data was downloaded using the Urban Institute's <code>educationdata</code> package.
</p>
<p>This data was used in the <em>Describing Variables</em> chapter of The Effect by Huntington-Klein
