      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``gov_transfers_density`` data contains data from Manacorda,
      Miguel, and Vigorito (2011) on government transfer program that
      was administered based on an income cutoff. As opposed to the
      ``gov_transfers`` data set, this data set only contains income
      information, but has a wider range of it, for use with density
      discontinuity tests.
