      :name: description

   The ``gov_transfers_density`` data contains data from Manacorda,
   Miguel, and Vigorito (2011) on government transfer program that was
   administered based on an income cutoff. As opposed to the
   ``gov_transfers`` data set, this data set only contains income
   information, but has a wider range of it, for use with density
   discontinuity tests.
