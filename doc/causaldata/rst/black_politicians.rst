      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``black_politicians`` data contains data from Broockman (2013)
      on a field experiment where the author sent fictional emails
      purportedly sent by Black people to legislators in the United
      States. The experiment sought to determine whether the effect of
      the email being from "out-of-district" (someone who can't vote for
      you and so provides no extrinsic motivation to reply) would have a
      smaller effect on response rates for Black legislators than for
      non-Black ones, providing evidence of additional intrinsic
      motivation on the part of Black legislators to help Black people.
