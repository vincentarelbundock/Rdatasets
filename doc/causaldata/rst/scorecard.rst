      This data is not just limited to four-year colleges and includes a
      very wide variety of institutions.

      Note that the labor market (earnings, working) and repayment rate
      data do not refer to the same cohort of students, but rather are
      matched on the year in which outcomes are recorded. Labor market
      data refers to cohorts beginning college as undergraduates ten
      years prior, repayment rate data refers to cohorts entering
      repayment seven years prior.

      Data was downloaded using the Urban Institute's ``educationdata``
      package.

      This data was used in the *Describing Variables* chapter of The
      Effect by Huntington-Klein
