      ``greek_data`` is a fictional data set from Table 2.2 in Chapter 2
      of Causal Inference. From the book: "Table 2.2 shows the data from
      our heart transplant randomized study. Besides data on treatment A
      (1 if the individual received a transplant, 0 otherwise) and
      outcome Y (1 if the individual died, 0 otherwise), Table 2.2 also
      contains data on the prognostic factor L (1 if the individual was
      in critical condition, 0 otherwise), which we measured before
      treatment was assigned."
