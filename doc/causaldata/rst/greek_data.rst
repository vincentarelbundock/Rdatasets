   ``greek_data`` is a fictional data set from Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 of
   Causal Inference. From the book: "Table 2.2 shows the data from our
   heart transplant randomized study. Besides data on treatment A (1 if
   the individual received a transplant, 0 otherwise) and outcome Y (1
   if the individual died, 0 otherwise), Table 2.2 also contains data on
   the prognostic factor L (1 if the individual was in critical
   condition, 0 otherwise), which we measured before treatment was
   assigned."
