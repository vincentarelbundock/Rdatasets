         :name: description

      This is a subsample of the data from the treated group in the
      National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW) and the comparison
      sample from the Population Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID). This
      data was previously analyzed extensively by Lalonde (1986) and
      Dehejia and Wahba (1999).

      A data frame with 614 observations (185 treated, 429 control).
      There are 9 variables measured for each individual.

      -  "treat" is the treatment assignment (1=treated, 0=control).

      -  "age" is age in years.

      -  "educ" is education in number of years of schooling.

      -  "race" is the individual's race/ethnicity, (Black, Hispanic, or
         White). Note previous versions of this dataset used indicator
         variables ``black`` and ``hispan`` instead of a single race
         variable.

      -  "married" is an indicator for married (1=married, 0=not
         married).

      -  "nodegree" is an indicator for whether the individual has a
         high school degree (1=no degree, 0=degree).

      -  "re74" is income in 1974, in U.S. dollars.

      -  "re75" is income in 1975, in U.S. dollars.

      -  "re78" is income in 1978, in U.S. dollars.

      "treat" is the treatment variable, "re78" is the outcome, and the
      others are pre-treatment covariates.
