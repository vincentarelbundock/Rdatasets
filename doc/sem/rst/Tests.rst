         :name: six-mental-tests

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These data are from the SAS manual and consist of six mental tests
      for 32 students, with some missing data. The three ``x`` variables
      are intended to load on a verbal factor, and the three ``y``
      variables on a math factor. The data can be used to illustrate the
      estimation of a confirmatory factor analysis model by multinormal
      full-information maximum-likelihood in the presence of missing
      data.
