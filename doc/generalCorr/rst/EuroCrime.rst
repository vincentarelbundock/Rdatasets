         :name: description

      This data set refers to crime in European countries during 2008.
      The sources are World Bank and Eurostat. The crime statistics
      refers to homicides. It avoids possible reporting bias from the
      presence of police officers, because homicide reporting in most
      countries is standardized. Typical usage is:
      ``data(EuroCrime);attach(EuroCrime)``. The secondary source
      ‘quandl.com’ was used for collecting these data.
