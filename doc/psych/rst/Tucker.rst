      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Tucker and Lewis (1973) introduced a reliability coefficient for
      ML factor analysis. Their example data set was previously reported
      by Tucker (1958) and taken from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941).
      The correlation matrix is a 9 x 9 for 710 subjects and has two
      correlated factors of ability: Word Fluency and Verbal.
