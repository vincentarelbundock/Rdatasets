         :name: description

      Holzinger-Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model of a
      general factor and uncorrelated group factors. The Holzinger data
      sets are original 14 \* 14 matrix from their paper as well as a 9
      \*9 matrix used as an example by Joreskog. The Thurstone
      correlation matrix is a 9 \* 9 matrix of correlations of ability
      items. The Reise data set is 16 \* 16 correlation matrix of mental
      health items. The Bechtholdt data sets are both 17 x 17
      correlation matrices of ability tests.

      Holzinger and Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model (one
      general factor and several group factors) for mental abilities.
      This is a nice demonstration data set of a hierarchical factor
      structure that can be analyzed using the ``omega`` function or
      using sem. The bifactor model is typically used in measures of
      cognitive ability.

      There are several ways to analyze such data. One is to use the
      ``omega`` function to do a hierarchical factoring using the
      Schmid-Leiman transformation. This can then be done as an
      exploratory and then as a confirmatory model using ``omegaSem``.
      Another way is to do a regular factor analysis and use either a
      ``bifactor`` or ``biquartimin`` rotation. These latter two
      functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011) bifactor and
      biquartimin transformations. The ``bifactor`` rotation suffers
      from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and
      thus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be
      preferred.

      The 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental
      speed tests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample
      size is 355.

      Another data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9
      cognitive abilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by
      Karl Joreskog (2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm
      and also appears in the LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. This data
      set represents the scores from the Grant White middle school for 9
      tests: "t01_visperc" "t02_cubes" "t04_lozenges" "t06_paracomp"
      "t07_sentcomp" "t09_wordmean" "t10_addition" "t12_countdot" and
      "t13_sccaps" and as variables x1 ... x9 (for the Grant-White
      school) in the lavaan package.

      Another classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which
      is discussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is
      used as example in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS
      manual for SAS. These nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and
      Thurstone, 1941 (based on other data) into three factors: Verbal
      Comprehension, Word Fluency, and Reasoning. The original data came
      from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) but were reanalyzed by
      Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two. McDonald, in
      turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of 17
      found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213.

      Another set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone
      (1933) is the data set of 4,175 male students reported by Carl
      Brigham of Princeton to the College Entrance Examination Board.
      (Brigham, 1932, Table VIII p 352.) This set does not show a clear
      bifactor solution but is included as a demonstration of the
      differences between a maximimum likelihood factor analysis
      solution versus a principal axis factor solution. On page 352, we
      are given reliability estimates of .86, .73, .83, .97,.94, .85,
      .92, .92, and .90. These are based upon sampling 743 boys.

      A parallel set (also from Brigham) is the correlation matrix of
      the same 9 variables for 2899 girls. (Thurstone.33G)

      Tucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941)
      for his example of ``interbattery`` factor analysis.

      More recent applications of the bifactor model are to the
      measurement of psychological status. The Reise data set is a
      correlation matrix based upon >35,000 observations to the Consumer
      Assessment of Health Care Provideers and Systems survey
      instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays (2007) describe a bifactor
      solution based upon 1,000 cases.

      The five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly
      (1-3), Doctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff
      (8,9), Getting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer
      service (14-16).

      The two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and
      Thurstone (1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used
      by McDonald to form the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are
      212 and 213 respectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory,
      verbal, words, space, number and reasoning with three markers for
      all expect the rote memory factor. 9 variables from this set
      appear in the Thurstone data set.

      Two more data sets with similar structures are found in the
      ``Harman`` data set. This includes the another 9 variables (with
      696 subjects) from Holzinger used by Harman
      ``link{Harman.Holzinger}`` as well as 8 affective variables from
      ``link{burt}``.

      Another data set that is worth examining for tests of bifactor
      structure is the holzinger.swineford data set which includes the
      original data from Holzinger and Swineford (1939) supplied by
      Keith Widaman. This is in the psychTools package.

      -  Bechtoldt.1: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N =
         212.

      -  Bechtoldt.2: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N =
         213.

      -  Holzinger: 14 x 14 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 355

      -  Holzinger.9: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 145

      -  Reise: 16 x 16 correlation matrix of health satisfaction items.
         N = 35,000

      -  Thurstone: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213

      -  Thurstone.33: Another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability
         tests, N=4175

      -  Thurstone:9: And yet another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of
         ability tests, N =710

         :name: note

      Note that these are tests, not items. Thus, it was possible to
      find the reliabilities of each test.

      For the Holzinger 14 tests these were found from 1- t2 where t =
      c(.332, .517, .360, .382, .354,.249, .444, .393, .455, .424, .393,
      .487, .534, .382) (page 53) and thus the reliabilities were 0.890,
      0.733, 0.870, 0.854, 0.875, 0.938, 0.803, 0.846, 0.793, 0.820,
      0.846, 0.763, 0.715, 0.854.

      For the Holzinger.9 tests, the reliabilities for the Grant-White
      tests were: .76, .57, .94, .65, .75, .87, .95, .84 and .89 (Keith
      Widaman, personal communication, 2020),
