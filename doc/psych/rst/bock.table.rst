      .. rubric:: Bock and Liberman (1970) data set of 1000 observations
         of the LSAT
         :name: bock-and-liberman-1970-data-set-of-1000-observations-of-the-lsat

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      An example data set used by McDonald (1999) as well as other
      discussions of Item Response Theory makes use of a data table on
      10 items (two sets of 5) from the Law School Admissions Test
      (LSAT). Included in this data set is the original table as well as
      the reponses for 1000 subjects on the first set (Figure
      Classification) and second set (Debate).

      .. rubric:: Format

      A data frame with 32 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``index``
         32 response patterns

      ``Q1``
         Responses to item 1

      ``Q2``
         Responses to item 2

      ``Q3``
         Responses to item 3

      ``Q4``
         Responses to item 4

      ``Q5``
         Responses to item 5

      ``Ob6``
         count of observations for the section 6 test

      ``Ob7``
         count of observations for the section 7 test

      Two other data sets are derived from the bock dataset. These are
      converted using the ``table2df`` function.

      lsat6
         reponses to 5 items for 1000 subjects on section 6

      lsat7
         reponses to 5 items for 1000 subjects on section 7

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The lsat6 data set is analyzed in the ltm package as well as by
      McDonald (1999). lsat7 is another 1000 subjects on part 7 of the
      LSAT. Both sets are described by Bock and Lieberman (1970). Both
      sets are useful examples of testing out IRT procedures and showing
      the use of ``tetrachoric`` correlations and item factor analysis
      using the ``irt.fa`` function.
