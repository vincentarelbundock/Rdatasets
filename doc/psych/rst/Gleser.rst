         :name: description

      Gleser, Cronbach and Rajaratnam (1965) discuss the estimation of
      variance components and their ratios as part of their introduction
      to generalizability theory. This is a adaptation of their
      "illustrative data for a completely matched G study" (Table 3). 12
      patients are rated on 6 symptoms by two judges. Components of
      variance are derived from the ANOVA.

      Generalizability theory is the application of a components of
      variance approach to the analysis of reliability. Given a G study
      (generalizability) the components are estimated and then may be
      used in a D study (Decision). Different ratios are formed as
      appropriate for the particular D study.
