         :name: description

      Five classic data sets reported by Harman (1967) are 9
      psychological (cognitive) variables taken from Holzinger and 8
      emotional variables taken from Burt. Two others are socioeconomic
      and political data sets. Additionally, 8 physical variables. All
      five of these are used for tests and demonstrations of various
      factoring algortithms.

      Harman.Holzinger. The nine psychological variables from Harman
      (1967, p 244) are taken from unpublished class notes of K.J.
      Holzinger with 696 participants. This is a subset of 12 tests with
      4 factors. It is yet another nice example of a bifactor solution.
      Bentler (2007) uses this data set to discuss reliablity analysis.
      The data show a clear bifactor structure and are a nice example of
      the various estimates of reliability included in the ``omega``
      function. Should not be confused with the ``Holzinger`` or
      ``Holzinger.9`` data sets in ``bifactor``.

      See also the Holzinger-Swineford data set of 301 subjects with 26
      variables in ``holzinger.swineford``. These data were provided by
      Keith Widaman. "The Holzinger and Swineford (1939) data have been
      used as a model data set by many investigators. For example,
      Harman (1976) used the "24 Psychological Variables" example
      prominently in his authoritative text on multiple factor analysis,
      and the data presented under this rubric consisted of 24 of the
      variables from the Grant-White school (N = 145). Meredith (1964a,
      1964b) used several variables from the Holzinger and Swineford
      study in his work on factorial invariance under selection.
      Joreskog (1971) based his work on multiple-group confirmatory
      factor analysis using the Holzinger and Swineford data, subsetting
      the data into four groups.

      Rosseel, who developed the "lavaan" package for R , included 9 of
      the manifest variables from Holzinger and Swineford (1939) as a
      "resident" data set when one downloads the lavaan package. Several
      background variables are included in this "resident" data set in
      addition to 9 of the psychological tests (which are named x1 - x9
      in the data set). When analyzing these data, I found the
      distributions of the variables (means, SDs) did not match the
      sample statistics from the original article. For example, in the
      "resident" data set in lavaan, scores on all manifest variables
      ranged between 0 and 10, sample means varied between 3 and 6, and
      sample SDs varied between 1.0 and 1.5. In the original data set,
      scores ranges were rather different across tests, with some
      variables having scores that ranged between 0 and 20, but other
      manifest variables having scores ranging from 50 to over 300 -
      with obvious attendant differences in sample means and SDs."

      Harman.Burt. Eight “emotional" variables are taken from Harman
      (1967, p 164) who in turn adapted them from Burt (1939). They are
      said be from 172 normal children aged nine to twelve. As pointed
      out by Harman, this correlation matrix is singular and has squared
      multiple correlations > 1. Because of this problem, it is a nice
      test case for various factoring algorithms. (For instance, omega
      will issue warning messages for fm="minres" or fm="pa" but will
      fail for fm="ml".)

      The Eight Physical Variables problem is taken from Harman (1976)
      and represents the correlations between eight physical variables
      for 305 girls. The two correlated clusters represent four measures
      of "lankiness" and then four measures of "stockiness". The
      original data were selected from 17 variables reported in an
      unpublished dissertation by Mullen (1939).

      Variable 6 ("Bitrochanteric diamter") is the distance between the
      outer points of the hips.

      The row names match the original Harman paper, the column names
      have been abbreviated.

      See also the ``usaf`` data set for other physical measurements.

      The ``fa`` solution for principal axes (fm="pa") matches the
      reported minres solution, as does the fm="minres".

      For those interested in teaching examples using various body
      measurements, see the body data set in the gclus package.

      The Burt data set probably has a typo in the original correlation
      matrix. Changing the Sorrow- Tenderness correlation from .87 to
      .81 makes the correlation positive definite.

      As pointed out by Jan DeLeeuw, the Burt data set is a subset of 8
      variables from the original 11 reported by Burt in 1915. That
      matrix has the same problem. See ``burt``.

      Other example data sets that are useful demonstrations of factor
      analysis are the seven bifactor examples in ``Bechtoldt`` and the
      24 ability measures in ``Harman74.cor``

      There are several other Harman examples in the psych package
      (i.e., Harman.8) as well as in the dataseta and GPArotation
      packages. The Harman 24 mental tests problem is in the basic
      datasets package at Harman74.cor.

      Other Harman data sets are 5 socioeconomic variables for 12 census
      tracts Harman.5 used by John Loehlin as an example for EFA.
      Another one of the many Harman (1967) data sets is
      Harman.political. This contains 8 political variables taken over
      147 election areas. The principal factor method with SMCs as
      communalities match those of table 8.18. The data are used by
      Dziubian and Shirkey as an example of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test
      of factor adequacy.
