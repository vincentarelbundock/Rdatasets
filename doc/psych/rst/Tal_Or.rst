         :name: description

      Nurit Tal-Or, Jonanathan Cohen, Yariv Tasfati, and Albert Gunther
      (2010) examined the presumed effect of media on other people and
      change in attitudes. This data set is from Study 2, and examined
      the effect of presumed influence of the media upon subsequent
      actions. It is used as an example of mediation by Hayes (2013) and
      for the mediate function.

      A data frame with 123 observations on the following 6 variables.

         Experimental Condition: 0 low media importance, 1 high media
         importance

      ``pmi``
         Presumed media influence (based upon the mean of two items

      ``import``
         Importance of the issue

      ``reaction``
         Subjects rated agreement about possible reactions to the story
         (mean of 4 items).

      ``gender``
         1 = male, 2 = female

      ``age``
         a numeric vector

      Tal-Or et al. (2010) examined the presumed effect of the media in
      two experimental studies. These data are from study 2. '...
      perceptions regarding the influence of a news story about an
      expected shortage in sugar were manipulated indirectly, by
      manipulating the perceived exposure to the news story, and
      behavioral intentions resulting from the story were consequently
      measured." (p 801).

      The data were downloaded from the webpages of Andrew Hayes
      (https://www.afhayes.com/public/hayes2018data.zip) supporting the
      first and second edition of his book. The name of the original
      data set was pmi. (Gender was recoded to reflect the number of X
      chromosomes).

      The original data are from Nurit Tal-Or, Jonathan Cohen, Yariv
      Tsfati, and Albert C. Gunther and are used with their kind
