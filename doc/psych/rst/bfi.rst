         :name: personality-items-representing-5-factors

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      25 personality self report items taken from the International
      Personality Item Pool (ipip.ori.org) were included as part of the
      Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA) web based
      personality assessment project. The data from 2800 subjects are
      included here as a demonstration set for scale construction,
      factor analysis, and Item Response Theory analysis. Three
      additional demographic variables (sex, education, and age) are
      also included. This data set is deprecated and users are
      encouraged to use ``bfi``.

      This data set is deprecated and users are encouraged to use
      ``bfi``.It is kept here backward compatability for one more
      release.

      The first 25 items are organized by five putative factors:
      Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and
      Opennness. The scoring key is created using ``make.keys``, the
      scores are found using ``score.items``.

      These five factors are a useful example of using ``irt.fa`` to do
      Item Response Theory based latent factor analysis of the
      ``polychoric`` correlation matrix. The endorsement plots for each
      item, as well as the item information functions reveal that the
      items differ in their quality.

      The item data were collected using a 6 point response scale: 1
      Very Inaccurate 2 Moderately Inaccurate 3 Slightly Inaccurate 4
      Slightly Accurate 5 Moderately Accurate 6 Very Accurate

      as part of the Synthetic Apeture Personality Assessment (SAPA
      https://www.sapa-project.org/) project. To see an example of the
      data collection technique, visit https://www.sapa-project.org/ or
      the International Cognitive Ability Resource at
      https://icar-project.org/. The items given were sampled from the
      International Personality Item Pool of Lewis Goldberg using the
      sampling technique of SAPA. This is a sample data set taken from
      the much larger SAPA data bank.
