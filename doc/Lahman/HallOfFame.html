<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This table links to the <code>People</code> table via the <code>playerID</code>.
</p>
<p><code>votedBy</code>: Most Hall of Fame inductees have been elected by the 
Baseball Writers Association of America (<code>BBWAA</code>).  Rules for election are
described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum#Selection_process">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum#Selection_process</a>.

## Eventual inductees tend to have increasing support over time.

# Note 1: Only two players whose maximum voting percentage
# was over 60% were not eventually inducted
# into the HOF: Gil Hodges and Jack Morris. 
# Red Ruffing was elected in a 1967 runoff election while
# the others have been voted in by the Veterans Committee. 

# Note 2: Of the players whose slope was &gt;= 2.5 among 
# non-inductees, only Jack Morris has not (yet) been 
# subsequently inducted into the HOF; however, his last year of
# eligibility was 2014 so he could be inducted by a future
# Veterans Committee.
