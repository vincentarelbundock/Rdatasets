      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset, guineapig_neurotransmission_df, is a data frame
      containing measurements of spontaneous current amplitudes recorded
      from individual brain cells in adult guinea pigs. The study
      investigated whether synaptic transmission occurs in quantal
      units, which would manifest as multimodal amplitude distributions
      with regularly spaced peaks.

      The dataset name has been kept as 'guineapig_neurotransmission_df'
      to avoid confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem. This
      naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
      NeuroDataSets package. The suffix 'df' indicates that the dataset
      is a data frame. The original content has not been modified.
