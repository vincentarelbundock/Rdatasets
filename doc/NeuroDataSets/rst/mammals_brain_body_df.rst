         :name: description

      This dataset, mammals_brain_body_df, is a data frame containing
      comparative neuroanatomical and life history data for 96 mammalian
      species. The data examine the relationship between brain size,
      body size, and reproductive characteristics across different
      mammal species.

      The dataset name has been kept as 'mammals_brain_body_df' to avoid
      confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem. This naming
      convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
      NeuroDataSets package. The suffix 'df' indicates that the dataset
      is a data frame. The original content has not been modified.
