         :name: description

      This dataset, oasis_dementia_mri_df, is a data frame containing
      longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data from 150 older adults
      (60-96 years) with repeated MRI scans over multiple visits. The
      study includes both nondemented and demented individuals, with 373
      total imaging sessions featuring 3-4 T1-weighted scans per
      session.
