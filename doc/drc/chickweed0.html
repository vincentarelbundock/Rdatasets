<h2>
Germination of common chickweed (<em>Stellaria media</em>)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Germination data from tests of chickweed seeds from chlorsulfuron resistant and sensitive biotypes
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(chickweed)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 35 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>start</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of left endpoints of the monitoring intervals</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>end</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of right endpoints of the monitoring intervals</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>count</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of the number of seeds germinated in the interval between start and end</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of the non-zero left endpoints of the monitoring intervals (often used for recording in practice)</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The germination tests of chickweed seeds from chlorsulfuron resistant and sensitive biotypes in central Zealand were 
done in petri dishes (diameter: 9.0cm) in a dark growth cabinet at a temperature of 5 degrees Celsius. The seeds were incubated for 
24 hours in a 0.3% solution of potassium nitrate in order to imbibe seeds prior to the test. A total of 200 seeds were placed on filter plate. 
After initialization of the tests, the number of germinated seeds was recorded and removed at 34 consecutive inspection times. 
Definition of a germinated seed was the breakthrough of the seed testa by the radicle. 
</p>
<p>Chickweed is known to have dormant seeds and therefore we would not expect 100% germination. It means that the upper limit 
of the proportion germinated has to be incorporated as a parameter into a model, which adequately reflects the experimental design 
as well as any expectations about the resulting outcome.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>
## Incorrect analysis using a logistic regression model
## (treating event times as binomial data)
## The argument "type" specifies that binomial data are supplied 
chickweed.m0a &lt;- drm(count/200 ~ time, weights = rep(200, 34), 
data = chickweed0, fct = LL.3(), type = "binomial")
summary(chickweed.m0a) # showing a summmary of the model fit (including parameter estimates)

## Incorrect analysis based on nonlinear regression
## LL.3() refers to the three-parameter log-logistic model
## As the argument "type" is not specified it is assumed that the data type
##  is continuous and nonlinear regression based on least squares estimation is carried out
chickweed.m0b &lt;- drm(count/200 ~ time, data = chickweed0, fct = LL.3())
summary(chickweed.m0b)  # showing a summmary of the model fit (including parameter estimates)

## How to re-arrange the data for fitting the event-time model
## (only for illustration of the steps needed for converting a dataset, 
##  but in this case not needed as both datasets are already provided in "drc")
#chickweed &lt;- data.frame(start = c(0, chickweed0$time), end = c(chickweed0$time, Inf)) 
#chickweed$count &lt;- c(0, diff(chickweed0$count), 200 - tail(chickweed0$count, 1))
#head(chickweed)  # showing top 6 lines of the dataset
#tail(chickweed)  # showing bottom 6 lines

## Fitting the event-time model (by specifying the argument type explicitly)
chickweed.m1 &lt;- drm(count~start+end, data = chickweed, fct = LL.3(), type = "event")
summary(chickweed.m1)  # showing a summmary of the model fit (including parameter estimates)

## Summary output with robust standard errors
## library(lmtest)
## library(sandwich)
## coeftest(chickweed.m1, vcov = sandwich)

## Calculating t10, t50, t90 for the distribution of viable seeds
ED(chickweed.m1, c(10, 50, 90))

## Plotting data and fitted regression curve
plot(chickweed.m1, xlab = "Time (hours)", ylab = "Proportion germinated", 
xlim=c(0, 340), ylim=c(0, 0.25), log="", lwd=2, cex=1.2)  
## Adding the fitted curve obtained using nonlinear regression
plot(chickweed.m0b, add = TRUE, lty = 2, xlim=c(0, 340), 
ylim=c(0, 0.25), log="", lwd=2, cex=1.2)
# Note: the event-time model has slightly better fit at the upper limit

## Enhancing the plot (to look like in the reference paper)
abline(h = 0.20011, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
text(-15, 0.21, "Upper limit: d", pos = 4, cex = 1.5)

segments(0,0.1,196,0.1, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
segments(196,0.1, 196, -0.1, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
text(200, -0.004, expression(paste("50% germination: ", t[50])), pos = 4, cex = 1.5)

abline(a = 0.20011/2-0.20011*20.77/4, b = 0.20011*20.77/4/196, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
#text(200, 0.1, expression(paste("Slope: ", b*(-d/(4*t[50])))), pos = 4, cex = 1.5)
text(200, 0.1, expression("Slope: b" %.% "constant"), pos = 4, cex = 1.5)
points(196, 0.1, cex = 2, pch = 0)


## Adding confidence intervals

## Predictions from the event-time model
#coefVec &lt;- coef(chickweed.m1)
#names(coefVec) &lt;- c("b","d","e")
#
#predFct &lt;- function(tival)
#{
#    as.numeric(deltaMethod(coefVec, paste("d/(1+exp(b*(log(",tival,")-log(e))))"), 
#    vcov(chickweed.m1)))
#}
#predFctv &lt;- Vectorize(predFct, "tival")
#
#etpred &lt;- t(predFctv(0:340))
#lines(0:340, etpred[,1]-1.96*etpred[,2], lty=1, lwd=2, col="darkgray")
#lines(0:340, etpred[,1]+1.96*etpred[,2], lty=1, lwd=2, col="darkgray")
#
### Predictions from the nonlinear regression model
#nrpred &lt;- predict(chickweed.m0b, data.frame(time=0:340), interval="confidence")
#lines(0:340, nrpred[,2], lty=2, lwd=2, col="darkgray")
#lines(0:340, nrpred[,3], lty=2, lwd=2, col="darkgray")
