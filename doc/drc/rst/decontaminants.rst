         a micro-organism
         :name: performance-of-decontaminants-used-in-the-culturing-of-a-micro-organism

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The two decontaminants 1-hexadecylpyridium chloride and oxalic
      acid were used. Additionally there was a control group (coded as
      concentration 0 and only included under oxalic acid).

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data("decontaminants")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 128 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``conc``
         a numeric vector of percentage weight per volume

      ``count``
         a numeric vector of numbers of M. bovis colonies at
         stationarity

      ``group``
         a factor with levels ``hpc`` and ``oxalic`` of the
         decontaminants used

      These data examplify Wadley's problem: counts where the maximum
      number is not known. The data were analyzed by Trajstman (1989)
      using a three-parameter logistic model and then re-analyzed by
      Morgan and Smith (1992) using a three-parameter Weibull type II
      model. In both cases the authors adjusted for overdispersion (in
      different ways).

      It seems that Morgan and Smith (1992) fitted separate models for
      the two decontaminants and using the control group for both model
      fits. In the example below a joint model is fitted where the
      control group is used once to determine a shared upper limit at
      concentration 0.
