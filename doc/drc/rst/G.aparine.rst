      .. rubric:: Herbicide applied to Galium aparine
         :name: herbicide-applied-to-galium-aparine

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Small plants of *Galium aparine*, growing in pots in a green
      house, were sprayed with the technical grade phenmidipham
      herbicide either alone or in mixture with an ester of oleic acid.
      The plants were allowed to grow in the green house for 14 days
      after herbicide treatment. Then the dry matter was measured per
      pot.

         data(G.aparine)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 240 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``dose``
         a numeric vector of dose value (g/ha)

      ``drymatter``
         a numeric vector of dry matter weights (mg/pot)

      ``treatment``
         a numeric vector giving the grouping: 0: control, 1,2:
         herbicide formulations
