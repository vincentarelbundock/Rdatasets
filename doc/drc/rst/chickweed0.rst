      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 35 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``start``
         a numeric vector of left endpoints of the monitoring intervals

      ``end``
         a numeric vector of right endpoints of the monitoring intervals

      ``count``
         a numeric vector of the number of seeds germinated in the
         interval between start and end

      ``time``
         a numeric vector of the non-zero left endpoints of the
         monitoring intervals (often used for recording in practice)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The germination tests of chickweed seeds from chlorsulfuron
      resistant and sensitive biotypes in central Zealand were done in
      petri dishes (diameter: 9.0cm) in a dark growth cabinet at a
      temperature of 5 degrees Celsius. The seeds were incubated for 24
      hours in a 0.3% solution of potassium nitrate in order to imbibe
      seeds prior to the test. A total of 200 seeds were placed on
      filter plate. After initialization of the tests, the number of
      germinated seeds was recorded and removed at 34 consecutive
      inspection times. Definition of a germinated seed was the
      breakthrough of the seed testa by the radicle.

      Chickweed is known to have dormant seeds and therefore we would
      not expect 100% germination. It means that the upper limit of the
      proportion germinated has to be incorporated as a parameter into a
      model, which adequately reflects the experimental design as well
      as any expectations about the resulting outcome.

         ## Incorrect analysis using a logistic regression model
         ## (treating event times as binomial data)
         ## The argument "type" specifies that binomial data are supplied 
         chickweed.m0a <- drm(count/200 ~ time, weights = rep(200, 34), 
         data = chickweed0, fct = LL.3(), type = "binomial")
         summary(chickweed.m0a) # showing a summmary of the model fit (including parameter estimates)

         ## Incorrect analysis based on nonlinear regression
         ## LL.3() refers to the three-parameter log-logistic model
         ## As the argument "type" is not specified it is assumed that the data type
         ##  is continuous and nonlinear regression based on least squares estimation is carried out
         chickweed.m0b <- drm(count/200 ~ time, data = chickweed0, fct = LL.3())
         summary(chickweed.m0b)  # showing a summmary of the model fit (including parameter estimates)

         ## How to re-arrange the data for fitting the event-time model
         ## (only for illustration of the steps needed for converting a dataset, 
         ##  but in this case not needed as both datasets are already provided in "drc")
         #chickweed <- data.frame(start = c(0, chickweed0$time), end = c(chickweed0$time, Inf)) 
         #chickweed$count <- c(0, diff(chickweed0$count), 200 - tail(chickweed0$count, 1))
         #head(chickweed)  # showing top 6 lines of the dataset
         #tail(chickweed)  # showing bottom 6 lines

         ## Fitting the event-time model (by specifying the argument type explicitly)
         chickweed.m1 <- drm(count~start+end, data = chickweed, fct = LL.3(), type = "event")
         summary(chickweed.m1)  # showing a summmary of the model fit (including parameter estimates)

         ## Summary output with robust standard errors
         ## library(lmtest)

         xlim=c(0, 340), ylim=c(0, 0.25), log="", lwd=2, cex=1.2)

         plot(chickweed.m0b, add = TRUE, lty = 2, xlim=c(0, 340), 
         ylim=c(0, 0.25), log="", lwd=2, cex=1.2)
         # Note: the event-time model has slightly better fit at the upper limit

         ## Enhancing the plot (to look like in the reference paper)

         segments(196,0.1, 196, -0.1, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
