      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      MCPA, 2,4-D, mecorprop and dichorlprop were applied either as
      technical grades materials (h = 1, 2, 3, 4) or as commercial
      formulations (herb = 5, 6, 7, 8). Each experimental unit consisted
      of five 1-week old seedlings grown together in a pot of nutrient
      solution during 14 days.

      ``h``
         a numeric vector

      ``w``
         a numeric vector

      ``y``
         a numeric vector

      ``dose``

      Data are parts of a larger joint action experiment with various
      herbicides.

      The eight herbicide preparations are naturally grouped into four
      pairs: (1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), and (4, 8), and in each pair of
      herbicides should have the same active ingredients but different
      formulation constituents, which were assumed to be biologically
      inert. The data consist of the 150 observations y of dry weights,
      each observation being the weight of five plants grown in the same
      pot. All the eight herbicide preparations have essentially the
      same mode of action in the plant; they all act like the plant
      auxins, which are plant regulators that affect cell enlongation an
      other essential metabolic pathways. One of the objects of the
      experiment was to test if the response functions were identical
      except for a multiplicative factor in the dose. This is a
      necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for a similar mode of
      action for the herbicides.
