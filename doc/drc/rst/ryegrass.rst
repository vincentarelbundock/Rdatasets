      .. rubric:: Effect of ferulic acid on growth of ryegrass
         :name: effect-of-ferulic-acid-on-growth-of-ryegrass

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A single dose-response curve.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(ryegrass)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 24 observations on the following 2 variables.

      rootl
         a numeric vector of root lengths

      conc
         a numeric vector of concentrations of ferulic acid

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data are part of a study to investigate the joint action of
      phenolic acids on root growth inhibition of perennial ryegrass
      (*Lolium perenne L*).

      ``conc`` is the concentration of ferulic acid is in mM, and
      ``rootl`` is the root length of perennial ryegrass measured in cm.
