      .. rubric:: Inhibition of photosynthesis
         :name: inhibition-of-photosynthesis

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from an experiment investigating the inhibition of
      photosynthesis in response to two synthetic photosystem II
      inhibitors, the herbicides diuron and bentazon. More specifically,
      the effect of oxygen consumption of thylakoid membranes
      (chloroplasts) from spinach was measured after incubation with the
      synthetic inhibitors in 5 assays, resulting in 5 dose-response
      curves.

         :name: format

      A data frame with 105 observations on the following four
      variables:

      CURVE
         a numeric vector specifying the assay or curve (a total of 5
         independent assays where used in this experiment).

      HERBICIDE
         a character vector specifying the herbicide applied: bentazon
         or diuron.

      DOSE
         a numeric vector giving the herbicide concentration in muMol.

      SLOPE
         a numeric vector with the measured response: oxygen consumption
         of thylakoid membranes.

      The experiment is described in more details by Streibig (1998).
