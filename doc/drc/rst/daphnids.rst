         :name: daphnia-test

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The number of immobile daphnids –in contrast to mobile daphnids–
      out of a total of 20 daphnids was counted for several
      concentrations of a toxic substance.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(daphnids)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 16 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``dose``
         a numeric vector

      ``no``
         a numeric vector

      ``total``
         a numeric vector

      ``time``
         a factor with levels ``24h`` ``48h``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The same daphnids were counted at 24h and later again at 48h.
