         :name: dose-response-profile-of-degradation-of-agrochemical-using-lepidium

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Estimation of the degradation profile of an agrochemical based on
      soil samples at depth 0-10cm from a calibration experiment.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(lepidium)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 42 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ``conc``
         a numeric vector of concentrations (g/ha)

      ``weight``
         a numeric vector of plant weight (g) after 3 weeks' growth

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      It is an experiment with seven concentrations and six replicates
      per concentration. *Lepidium* is rather robust as it only responds
      to high concentrations.
