         :name: effect-of-erythromycin-on-mixed-sewage-microorganisms

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Relative growth rate in biomass of mixed sewage microorganisms
      (per hour) as a function of increasing concentrations of the
      antibiotic erythromycin (mg/l).

      A data frame with 57 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``cell``
         a numeric vector

      ``dose1``
         a numeric vector

      ``pct1``
         a numeric vector

      ``rgr1``
         a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data stem from an experiment investigating the effect of
      pharmaceuticals, that are used in human and veterinary medicine
      and that are being released into the aquatic environment through
      waste water or through manure used for fertilising agricultural
      land. The experiment constitutes a typical dose-response
      situation. The dose is concentration of the antibiotic
      erythromycin (mg/l), which is an antibiotic that can be used by
      persons or animals showing allergy to penicillin, and the measured
      response is the relative growth rate in biomass of mixed sewage
      microorganisms (per hour), measured as turbidity two hours after
      exposure by means of a spectrophotometer. The experiment was
      designed in such a way that eight replicates were assigned to the
      control (dose 0), but no replicates were assigned to the 7
      non-zero doses. Further details are found in Christensen et al
      (2006).
