      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Estimation of the degradation profile of an agrochemical based on
      soil samples at depth 0-10cm from a calibration experiment.

         data(nasturtium)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 42 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ``conc``
         a numeric vector of concentrations (g/ha)

      ``weight``
         a numeric vector of plant weight (mg) after 3 weeks' growth

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      It is an experiment with seven concentrations and six replicates
      per concentration. *Nasturtium* is sensitive and its weight
      reduces noticeable at low concentrations.

      Racine-Poon (1988) suggests using a three-parameter log-logistic
      model.
