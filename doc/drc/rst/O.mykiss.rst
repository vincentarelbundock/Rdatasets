      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Test data from a 21 day fish test following the guidelines OECD
      GL204, using the test organism Rainbow trout *Oncorhynchus
      mykiss*.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(O.mykiss)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 70 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ``conc``
         a numeric vector of concentrations (mg/l)

      ``weight``
         a numeric vector of wet weights (g)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Weights are measured after 28 days.
