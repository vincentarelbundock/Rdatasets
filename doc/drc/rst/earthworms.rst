      .. rubric:: Earthworm toxicity test
         :name: earthworm-toxicity-test

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The dataset was obtained from a toxicity test using earthworms,
      and it contains the number of earthworms remaining in a container
      that was contaminated with a toxic substance (not disclosed) at
      various doses; so the number of earthworms not migrating to the
      neighbouring uncontaminated container.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(earthworms)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 35 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``dose``
         a numeric vector of dose values

      ``number``
         a numeric vector containing counts of remaining earthworms in
         the container

      ``total``
         a numeric vector containing total number of earthworms put in
         the containers

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      At dose 0 around half of the earthworms is expected be in each of
      the two containers. Thus it is not appropriate to fit an ordinary
      logistic regression with log(dose) as explanatory variable to
      these data as it implies an upper limit of 1 at dose 0 and in fact
      this model does not utilise the observations at dose 0 (see the
      example section below).

         ## Fitting a logistic regression model

         ## Fitting an extended logistic regression model 
         ##  where the upper limit is estimated
         earthworms.m2 <- drm(number/total~dose, weights = total, data = earthworms,

         modelFit(earthworms.m2)  # goodness-of-fit test
         # improvement not visible in test!!!

         ## Comparing model1 and model2
