   .. rubric:: Competition between two biotypes
      :name: competition-between-two-biotypes

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   To assess the competitive ability between two biotypes of *Lolium
   rigidum*, one resistant to glyphosate and the other a sensitive wild
   type, the density of resistant and sensitive biotypes was counted
   after germination.

   .. rubric:: Usage
      :name: usage

   ::

      data(RScompetition)

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 49 observations on the following 3 variables.

   ``z``
      a numeric vector with densities of the resistant biotype
      (plants/m2)

   ``x``
      a numeric vector with densities of the sensitive biotype
      (plants/m2)

   ``biomass``
      a numeric vector of biomass weight (g/plant)

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   A hyperbolic model (Jensen, 1993) is describing the data reasonably
   well.

   .. rubric:: Source
      :name: source

   The dataset is from Pedersen et al (2007).
