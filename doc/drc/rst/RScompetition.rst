      .. rubric:: Competition between two biotypes
         :name: competition-between-two-biotypes

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      To assess the competitive ability between two biotypes of *Lolium
      rigidum*, one resistant to glyphosate and the other a sensitive
      wild type, the density of resistant and sensitive biotypes was
      counted after germination.

         :name: usage

      ::

         data(RScompetition)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 49 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``z``
         a numeric vector with densities of the resistant biotype
         (plants/m2)

      ``x``
         a numeric vector with densities of the sensitive biotype
         (plants/m2)

      ``biomass``
         a numeric vector of biomass weight (g/plant)

      A hyperbolic model (Jensen, 1993) is describing the data
      reasonably well.

      .. rubric:: Source

      The dataset is from Pedersen et al (2007).
