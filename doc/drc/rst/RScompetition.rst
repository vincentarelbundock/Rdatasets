Competition between two biotypes
--------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

To assess the competitive ability between two biotypes of *Lolium
rigidum*, one resistant to glyphosate and the other a sensitive wild
type, the density of resistant and sensitive biotypes was counted after
germination.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   data(RScompetition)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 49 observations on the following 3 variables.

``z``
   a numeric vector with densities of the resistant biotype (plants/m2)

``x``
   a numeric vector with densities of the sensitive biotype (plants/m2)

``biomass``
   a numeric vector of biomass weight (g/plant)

Details
~~~~~~~

A hyperbolic model (Jensen, 1993) is describing the data reasonably
well.

Source
~~~~~~

The dataset is from Pedersen et al (2007).
