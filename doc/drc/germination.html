<h2>
Germination of three crops
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Germination data were obtained from experiments involving the three species mungbean, rice, and wheat, which were opposed
to different temperatures between 10 and 40 degrees Celsius. Experiments lasted at most 18 days.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(germination)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 192 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>temp</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of temperatures that seeds were exposed to</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>species</code></dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>mungbean</code> <code>rice</code> <code>wheat</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>start</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of left endpoints of the monitoring intervals</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>end</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector of right endpoints of the monitoring intervals</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>germinated</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the numbers of seeds germinated</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each of the three species mungbean, rice, and wheat, a total of 20 seeds were uniformly distributed on filter paper in a petri dish (diameter: 9.0cm) 
and then placed in dark climate cabinets with different temperatures (10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40 degrees Celsius). Not all of the temperatures were applied to all species. 
The germinated seeds were counted and removed from the petri dish on a daily basis up to 18 days (or until all seeds had germinated). I
</p>
<p>n this experiment we also assume that the upper limit of the proportion germinated is a parameter that has to be estimated from the data. Moreover, we assume 
that different combinations of species and temperature may lead to different germination curves with respect to slope, time required for 50% germination, and upper limit.
