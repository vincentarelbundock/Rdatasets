      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Indometh`` data frame has 66 rows and 3 columns of data on
      the pharmacokinetics of indometacin (or, older spelling,
      ‘indomethacin’).

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      An object of class
      ``c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame")``
      containing the following columns:

      Subject
         an ordered factor with containing the subject codes. The
         ordering is according to increasing maximum response.

      time
         a numeric vector of times at which blood samples were drawn
         (hr).

      conc
         a numeric vector of plasma concentrations of indometacin
         (mcg/ml).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Each of the six subjects were given an intravenous injection of
      indometacin.

      This dataset was originally part of package ``nlme``, and that has
      methods (including for ``[``, ``as.data.frame``, ``plot`` and
      ``print``) for its grouped-data classes.
