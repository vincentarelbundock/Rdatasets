         :name: biochemical-oxygen-demand

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``BOD`` data frame has 6 rows and 2 columns giving the
      biochemical oxygen demand versus time in an evaluation of water
      quality.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``Time``
         A numeric vector giving the time of the measurement (days).

      ``demand``
         A numeric vector giving the biochemical oxygen demand (mg/l).
