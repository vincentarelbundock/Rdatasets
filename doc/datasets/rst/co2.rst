         :name: mauna-loa-atmospheric-co2-concentration

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Atmospheric concentrations of CO\ ``_2`` are expressed in parts
      per million (ppm) and reported in the preliminary 1997 SIO
      manometric mole fraction scale.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A time series of 468 observations; monthly from 1959 to 1997.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The values for February, March and April of 1964 were missing and
