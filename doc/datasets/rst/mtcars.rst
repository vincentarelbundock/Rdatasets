         :name: note

      Henderson and Velleman (1981) comment in a footnote to Table 1:
      ‘Hocking [original transcriber]'s noncrucial coding of the Mazda's
      rotary engine as a straight six-cylinder engine and the Porsche's
      flat engine as a V engine, as well as the inclusion of the diesel
      Mercedes 240D, have been retained to enable direct comparisons to
      be made with previous analyses.’
