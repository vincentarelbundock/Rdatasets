         :name: elisa-assay-of-dnase

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``DNase`` data frame has 176 rows and 3 columns of data
      obtained during development of an ELISA assay for the recombinant
      protein DNase in rat serum.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         DNase

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      An object of class
      ``c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame")``
      containing the following columns:

      Run
         an ordered factor with levels ``10`` < ... < ``3`` indicating
         the assay run.

      conc
         a numeric vector giving the known concentration of the protein.

      density
         a numeric vector giving the measured optical density
         (dimensionless) in the assay. Duplicate optical density
         measurements were obtained.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This dataset was originally part of package ``nlme``, and that has
      methods (including for ``[``, ``as.data.frame``, ``plot`` and
      ``print``) for its grouped-data classes.
