      .. rubric:: Growth of Orange Trees
         :name: growth-of-orange-trees

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Orange`` data frame has 35 rows and 3 columns of records of
      the growth of orange trees.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         Orange

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      An object of class
      ``c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame")``
      containing the following columns:

      Tree
         an ordered factor indicating the tree on which the measurement
         is made. The ordering is according to increasing maximum
         diameter.

      age
         a numeric vector giving the age of the tree (days since
         1968/12/31)

      circumference
         a numeric vector of trunk circumferences (mm). This is probably
         “circumference at breast height”, a standard measurement in
         forestry.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This dataset was originally part of package ``nlme``, and that has
      methods (including for ``[``, ``as.data.frame``, ``plot`` and
      ``print``) for its grouped-data classes.
