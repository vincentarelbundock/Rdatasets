      R currently contains the following “state” data sets. Note that
      all data are arranged according to alphabetical order of the state
      names.

      ``state.abb``:
         character vector of 2-letter abbreviations for the state names.

      ``state.area``:
         numeric vector of state areas (in square miles).

      ``state.center``:
         list with components named ``x`` and ``y`` giving the
         approximate geographic center of each state in negative
         longitude and latitude. Alaska and Hawaii are placed just off
         the West Coast. See ‘Examples’ on how to “correct”.

      ``state.division``:
         ``factor`` giving state divisions (New England, Middle
         Atlantic, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South
         Central, East North Central, West North Central, Mountain, and
         Pacific).

      ``state.name``:
         character vector giving the full state names.

      ``state.region``:
         ``factor`` giving the region (Northeast, South, North Central,
         West) that each state belongs to.

      ``state.x77``:
         matrix with 50 rows and 8 columns giving the following
         statistics in the respective columns.

         ``Population``:
            population estimate as of July 1, 1975

         ``Income``:
            per capita income (1974)

         ``Illiteracy``:
            illiteracy (1970, percent of population)

         ``Life Exp``:
            life expectancy in years (1969–71)

         ``Murder``:
            murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate per 100,000
            population (1976)

         ``HS Grad``:
            percent high-school graduates (1970)

         ``Frost``:
            mean number of days with minimum temperature below freezing
            (1931–1960) in capital or large city

         ``Area``:
            land area in square miles

      Note that a square mile is by definition exactly
      ``(cm(1760 * 3 * 12) / 100 / 1000)^2`` ``km^2``, i.e.,
      ``2.589988110336 km^2``.
