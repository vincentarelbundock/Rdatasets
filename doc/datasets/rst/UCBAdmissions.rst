      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Aggregate data on applicants to graduate school at Berkeley for
      the six largest departments in 1973 classified by admission and
      sex.

      A 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 4526
      observations on 3 variables. The variables and their levels are as
      follows:

      == ========== ==================
      No Name       Levels
      1  ``Admit``  Admitted, Rejected
      2  ``Gender`` Male, Female
      3  ``Dept``   A, B, C, D, E, F
      == ========== ==================

      This data set is frequently used for illustrating Simpson's
      paradox, see Bickel et al. (1975). At issue is whether the data
      show evidence of sex bias in admission practices. There were 2691
      male applicants, of whom 1198 (44.5%) were admitted, compared with
      1835 female applicants of whom 557 (30.4%) were admitted. This
      gives a sample odds ratio of 1.83, indicating that males were
      almost twice as likely to be admitted. In fact, graphical methods
      (as in the example below) or log-linear modelling show that the
      apparent association between admission and sex stems from
      differences in the tendency of males and females to apply to the
      individual departments (females used to apply *more* to
      departments with higher rejection rates).

      This data set can also be used for illustrating methods for
      graphical display of categorical data, such as the general-purpose
      mosaicplot or the fourfoldplot for 2-by-2-by-``k`` tables.
