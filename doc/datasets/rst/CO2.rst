      .. rubric:: Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants
         :name: carbon-dioxide-uptake-in-grass-plants

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``CO2`` data frame has 84 rows and 5 columns of data from an
      experiment on the cold tolerance of the grass species *Echinochloa
      crus-galli*.

      .. code:: R

         CO2

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      An object of class
      ``c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame")``
      containing the following columns:

      Plant
         an ordered factor with levels ``Qn1`` < ``Qn2`` < ``Qn3`` < ...
         < ``Mc1`` giving a unique identifier for each plant.

      Type
         a factor with levels ``Quebec`` ``Mississippi`` giving the
         origin of the plant

      Treatment
         a factor with levels ``nonchilled`` ``chilled``

      conc
         a numeric vector of ambient carbon dioxide concentrations
         (mL/L).

      uptake
         a numeric vector of carbon dioxide uptake rates
         (``\mu\mbox{mol}/m^2`` sec).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The ``CO_2`` uptake of six plants from Quebec and six plants from
      Mississippi was measured at several levels of ambient ``CO_2``
      concentration. Half the plants of each type were chilled overnight
      before the experiment was conducted.

      This dataset was originally part of package ``nlme``, and that has
      methods (including for ``[``, ``as.data.frame``, ``plot`` and
      ``print``) for its grouped-data classes.
