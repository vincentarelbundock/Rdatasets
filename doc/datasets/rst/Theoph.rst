      The ``Theoph`` data frame has 132 rows and 5 columns of data from
      an experiment on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline.

      .. rubric:: Format

      An object of class
      ``c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame")``
      containing the following columns:

      Subject
         an ordered factor with levels ``1``, ..., ``12`` identifying
         the subject on whom the observation was made. The ordering is
         by increasing maximum concentration of theophylline observed.

      Wt
         weight of the subject (kg).

      Dose
         dose of theophylline administered orally to the subject
         (mg/kg).

      Time
         time since drug administration when the sample was drawn (hr).

      conc
         theophylline concentration in the sample (mg/L).

      Boeckmann, Sheiner and Beal (1994) report data from a study by Dr.
      Robert Upton of the kinetics of the anti-asthmatic drug
      theophylline. Twelve subjects were given oral doses of
      theophylline then serum concentrations were measured at 11 time
      points over the next 25 hours.

      These data are analyzed in Davidian and Giltinan (1995) and
      Pinheiro and Bates (2000) using a two-compartment open
      pharmacokinetic model, for which a self-starting model function,
      ``SSfol``, is available.

      This dataset was originally part of package ``nlme``, and that has
      methods (including for ``[``, ``as.data.frame``, ``plot`` and
      ``print``) for its grouped-data classes.
