      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      ``USArrests`` contains the data as in McNeil's monograph. For the
      ``UrbanPop`` percentages, a review of the table (No. 21) in the
      Statistical Abstracts 1975 reveals a transcription error for
      Maryland (and that McNeil used the same “round to even” rule that
      **R**'s ``round()`` uses), as found by Daniel S Coven (Arizona).

      See the example below on how to correct the error and improve
      accuracy for the ‘<n>.5’ percentages.

         ## ==> UA.C  is now a *C*orrected version of  USArrests
