      .. rubric:: Chicken Weights by Feed Type
         :name: chicken-weights-by-feed-type

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the
      effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of
      chickens.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

         chickwts

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 71 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ``weight``
         a numeric variable giving the chick weight.

      ``feed``
         a factor giving the feed type.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details
