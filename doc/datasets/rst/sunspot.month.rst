         :name: monthly-sunspot-data-from-1749-to-present

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Monthly numbers of sunspots, as from the World Data Center, aka
      SIDC. This is the version of the data that will occasionally be
      updated when new counts become available.

         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         sunspot.month

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      The univariate time series ``sunspot.year`` and ``sunspot.month``
      contain 289 and 2988 observations, respectively. The objects are
      of class ``"ts"``.

      ``sunspot.month`` is a longer version of ``sunspots``; the latter
      runs until 1983 and is kept fixed (for reproducibility as example
      dataset).

      .. rubric:: Examples
         :name: examples

      .. code:: R

         require(stats); require(graphics)
         ## Compare the monthly series
         plot (sunspot.month,
               main="sunspot.month & sunspots [package'datasets']", col=2)
         lines(sunspots) # -> faint differences where they overlap

         ## Now look at the difference :
         all(tsp(sunspots)     [c(1,3)] ==
             tsp(sunspot.month)[c(1,3)]) ## Start & Periodicity are the same
         n1 <- length(sunspots)
         table(eq <- sunspots == sunspot.month[1:n1]) #>  132  are different !
         i <- which(!eq)
         rug(time(eq)[i])
         s1 <- sunspots[i] ; s2 <- sunspot.month[i]
         cbind(i = i, time = time(sunspots)[i], sunspots = s1, ss.month = s2,
               perc.diff = round(100*2*abs(s1-s2)/(s1+s2), 1))

         ## How to recreate the "old" sunspot.month (R <= 3.0.3):
         .sunspot.diff <- cbind(
             i = c(1202L, 1256L, 1258L, 1301L, 1407L, 1429L, 1452L, 1455L,
                   1663L, 2151L, 2329L, 2498L, 2594L, 2694L, 2819L),
             res10 = c(1L, 1L, 1L, -1L, -1L, -1L, 1L, -1L,
                   1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 20L, 1L))
         ssm0 <- sunspot.month[1:2988]
         with(as.data.frame(.sunspot.diff), ssm0[i] <<- ssm0[i] - res10/10)
         sunspot.month.0 <- ts(ssm0, start = 1749, frequency = 12)
