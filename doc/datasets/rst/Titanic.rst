      The sinking of the Titanic is a famous event, and new books are
      still being published about it. Many well-known facts—from the
      proportions of first-class passengers to the ‘women and children
      first’ policy, and the fact that that policy was not entirely
      successful in saving the women and children in the third class—are
      reflected in the survival rates for various classes of passenger.

      These data were originally collected by the British Board of Trade
      in their investigation of the sinking. Note that there is not
      complete agreement among primary sources as to the exact numbers
      on board, rescued, or lost.

      Due in particular to the very successful film ‘Titanic’, the last
      years saw a rise in public interest in the Titanic. Very detailed
      data about the passengers is now available on the Internet, at
      sites such as *Encyclopedia Titanica*
      (https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/).
