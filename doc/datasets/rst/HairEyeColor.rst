      A 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 592
      observations on 3 variables. The variables and their levels are as
      follows:

      == ======== =========================
      No Name     Levels
      1  ``Hair`` Black, Brown, Red, Blond
      2  ``Eye``  Brown, Blue, Hazel, Green
      3  ``Sex``  Male, Female
      == ======== =========================

      The Hair ``\times`` Eye table comes from a survey of students at
      the University of Delaware reported by Snee (1974). The split by
      ``Sex`` was added by Friendly (1992a) for didactic purposes.

      This data set is useful for illustrating various techniques for
      the analysis of contingency tables, such as the standard
      chi-squared test or, more generally, log-linear modelling, and
      graphical methods such as mosaic plots, sieve diagrams or
      association plots.

      Snee (1974) gives the two-way table aggregated over ``Sex``. The
      ``Sex`` split of the ‘Brown hair, Brown eye’ cell was changed to
      agree with that used by Friendly (2000).
