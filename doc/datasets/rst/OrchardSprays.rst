      .. rubric:: Potency of Orchard Sprays
         :name: potency-of-orchard-sprays

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      An experiment was conducted to assess the potency of various
      constituents of orchard sprays in repelling honeybees, using a
      Latin square design.

      A data frame with 64 observations on 4 variables.

      ==== ============= ======= ====================
      [,1] ``rowpos``    numeric Row of the design
      [,2] ``colpos``    numeric Column of the design
      [,3] ``treatment`` factor  Treatment level
      [,4] ``decrease``  numeric Response

      Individual cells of dry comb were filled with measured amounts of
      lime sulphur emulsion in sucrose solution. Seven different
      concentrations of lime sulphur ranging from a concentration of
      1/100 to 1/1,562,500 in successive factors of 1/5 were used as
      well as a solution containing no lime sulphur.

      The responses for the different solutions were obtained by
      releasing 100 bees into the chamber for two hours, and then
      measuring the decrease in volume of the solutions in the various
      cells.

      An ``8 \times 8`` Latin square design was used and the treatments
      were coded as follows:

      = ==================================
      A highest level of lime sulphur
      B next highest level of lime sulphur
      . 
      . 
      . 
      G lowest level of lime sulphur
      H no lime sulphur
