         :name: occupational-status-of-fathers-and-their-sons

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Cross-classification of a sample of British males according to

      status.

      .. code:: R

         occupationalStatus

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A ``table`` of counts, with classifying factors ``origin``
      (father's occupational status; levels ``1:8``) and ``destination``
      (son's occupational status; levels ``1:8``).
