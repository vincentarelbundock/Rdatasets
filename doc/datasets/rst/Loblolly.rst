      .. rubric:: Growth of Loblolly Pine Trees
         :name: growth-of-loblolly-pine-trees

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Loblolly`` data frame has 84 rows and 3 columns of records
      of the growth of Loblolly pine trees.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         Loblolly

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      An object of class
      ``c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame")``
      containing the following columns:

      height
         a numeric vector of tree heights (ft).

      age
         a numeric vector of tree ages (yr).

      Seed
         an ordered factor indicating the seed source for the tree. The
         ordering is according to increasing maximum height.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This dataset was originally part of package ``nlme``, and that has
      methods (including for ``[``, ``as.data.frame``, ``plot`` and
      ``print``) for its grouped-data classes.
