      Under the life-cycle savings hypothesis as developed by Franco
      Modigliani, the savings ratio (aggregate personal saving divided
      by disposable income) is explained by per-capita disposable
      income, the percentage rate of change in per-capita disposable
      income, and two demographic variables: the percentage of
      population less than 15 years old and the percentage of the
      population over 75 years old. The data are averaged over the
      decade 1960–1970 to remove the business cycle or other short-term
      fluctuations.

      in turn obtained the data from Sterling (1977).
