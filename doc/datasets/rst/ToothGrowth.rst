         :name: the-effect-of-vitamin-c-on-tooth-growth-in-guinea-pigs

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for
      tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three
      dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two
      delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin
      C and coded as ``VC``).

      A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.
