      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset contains 44 observations, 11 observations from 4
      datasets generated by Francis Anscombe to demonstrate that
      statistical summary measures alone cannot capture the full
      relationship between two variables (here, ``x`` and ``y``).
      Anscombe emphasized the importance of visualizing data prior to
      calculating summary statistics.

      A dataframe with 44 rows and 3 variables:

      -  ``dataset``: the dataset the values come from

      -  ``x``: the x-variable

      -  ``y``: the y-variable

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      -  Dataset 1 has a linear relationship between ``x`` and ``y``

      -  Dataset 2 has shows a nonlinear relationship between ``x`` and
         ``y``

      -  Dataset 3 has a linear relationship between ``x`` and ``y``
         with a single outlier

      -  Dataset 4 has shows no relationship between ``x`` and ``y``
         with a single outlier that serves as a high-leverage point.

      In each of the datasets the following statistical summaries hold:

      -  mean of ``x``: 9

      -  variance of ``x``: 11

      -  mean of ``y``: 7.5

      -  variance of y: 4.125

      -  correlation between ``x`` and ``y``: 0.816

      -  linear regression between ``x`` and ``y``: ``⁠y = 3 + 0.5x⁠``

      -  ``R^2`` for the regression: 0.67
