</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Grown in Indiana in 1941.
</p>
<p>The column ordinates in this R package dataset are not quite exactly
the same as in the field due to the presence of roads.
</p>
<p>Plants were spaced 3 feet apart in rows 6 feet apart, 330 feet
long. Each row was divided into 3 sections of 34 plants sparated by
strips 12 feet long to provide roadways for vehicles.
</p>
<p>Each row was divided into 4-plant plots, with 8 plots in each section of
row and with one plant left as a guard at the end of each section.
</p>
<p>There were 49 plants missing out of 3072 total plants, but these have been ignored.
</p>
<p>Note, the data given in Table 1 of Hartman are for 8-plant plots!
</p>
<p>Field width: 3 sections (34 plants * 3 feet) + 2 roads * 12 feet = 330 feet.
</p>
<p>Field length: 32 rows * 6 feet = 192 feet
</p>
<p>As oriented on the page, plots were, on average, 330/12=27.5. feet wide, 6 feet tall.
</p>
<p>Discussion notes from Hartman.
</p>
<p>Total yield is 26001 pounds. Hartman says the yield of the field was
10.24 tons per acre, which we can verify:
</p>
<p>26001 lb/field * (1/384 field/plot) * (1/(24*6) plot/ft2) * (43560 ft2/acre) * (1/2000 tons/lb) = 10.24 tons/acre
</p>
<p>The rows on the top/bottom (north/south) were intended as guard rows,
and had yields similar to the other rows, suggesting that competition
between rows did not exist. For comparing varieties, 96*6 foot plots
work well.
</p>
