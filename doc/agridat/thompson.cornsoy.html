<h2>
Multi-environment trial of corn &amp; soybean, 1930-1962, with temperature and precipitation
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Average yield of corn and soybeans in five U.S. states
(IA, IL, IN, MO, OH) during the years 1930-1962.
Pre-season precipitation and average temperature and precipitation
during each month of the growing season is included.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note: The Iowa corn data has sometimes been identified (in other
sources) as the &quot;Iowa wheat&quot; data, but this is incorrect.
</p>
<p>The 'year' variable affects yield through (1) improvements in
plant genetics (2) changes in management techniques such as
fertilizer, chemicals, tillage, planting date, and
(3) climate, pest infestations, etc.
</p>
<p>Double-cross corn hybrids were introduced in the 1920s.  Single-cross
hybrids became common around 1960.
</p>
<p>During World War II, nitrogen was used in the production of TNT for
bombs.  After the war, these factories switched to producing ammonia
for fertilizer.  Nitrogen fertilizer use greatly increased after WWII
and is a major reason for yield gains of corn.  Soybeans gain little
benefit from nitrogen fertilizer.  The other major reason for
increasing yields in both crops is due to improved plant genetics.
</p>
<p>Crops are often planted in May, and harvest begins in September.
</p>
<p>Yields in 1936 were very low due to July being one of the hottest and
driest on record.
</p>
<p>Some relevant maps of yield, heat, and precipitation can be found in
<em>Atlas of crop yield and summer weather patterns, 1931-1975</em>,
https://www.isws.illinois.edu/pubdoc/C/ISWSC-150.pdf
</p>
<p>The following notes pertain to the Iowa data.
</p>
<p>The 1947 June precipitation of 10.33 inches was the wettest June on
record (a new Iowa June record of 10.34 inches was set in 2010).
As quoted in <em>Monthly Weather Review</em> (Dec 1957, p. 396)
&quot;The dependence of Iowa agriculture upon the vagaries of the weather
was closely demonstrated during the 1947 season.  A cool wet spring
delayed crop planting activity and plant growth;
then, in addition, a hard freeze on May 29th ... further set back the
corn.  The heavy rains and subsequent floods during June caused
appreciable crop acreage to be abandoned ... followed by a hot dry
weather regime that persisted from mid-July through the first week
of September.&quot;
</p>
<p>In 1949 soybean yields were average while corn yields were low.
From the same source above,
&quot;The year 1949 saw the greatest infestation of corn borer in the
history of corn in Iowa&quot;.
</p>
<p>1955 yields were reduced due to dry weather in late July and August.
