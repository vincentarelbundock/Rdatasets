<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Charles Darwin, in 1876, reported data from an experiment that he had
conducted on the heights of corn plants.  The
seeds came from the same parents, but some seeds were produced from
self-fertilized parents and some seeds were produced from
cross-fertilized parents.  Pairs of seeds were planted in pots.
Darwin hypothesized that cross-fertilization produced produced more
robust and vigorous offspring.
</p>
<p>Darwin wrote, &quot;I long doubted whether it was worth while to give the
measurements of each separate plant, but have decided to do so, in
order that it may be seen that the superiority of the crossed plants
over the self-fertilised, does not commonly depend on the presence of
two or three extra fine plants on the one side, or of a few very poor
plants on the other side. Although several observers have insisted in
general terms on the offspring from intercrossed varieties being
superior to either parent-form, no precise measurements have been
given;* and I have met with no observations on the effects of crossing
and self-fertilising the individuals of the same variety. Moreover,
experiments of this kind require so much time&ndash;mine having been
continued during eleven years&ndash;that they are not likely soon to be
repeated.&quot;
</p>
<p>Darwin asked his cousin Francis Galton for help in understanding the
data.  Galton did not have modern statistical methods to approach
the problem and said, &quot;I doubt, after making many tests, whether it is
possible to derive useful conclusions from these few observations.  We
ought to have at least 50 plants in each case, in order to be in a
position to deduce fair results&quot;.
</p>
<p>Later, R. A. Fisher used Darwin's data in a book about design of
experiments and showed that a t-test exhibits a significant difference
between the two groups.
