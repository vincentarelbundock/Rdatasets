<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Experiments conducted in Trinidad.
</p>
<p>Plots were marked in May 1939 in Fields 1, 2, and 3. Prior to 1939 it
was difficult to obtain significant results on this land.
</p>
<p>Plots were 1/40 acre each, 33 feet square. Discard between blocks (the
rows) was 7 feet and between plots (the columns) was 4 feet. For
roadways, a gap of 14 feet is between blocks 10 and 11 and a gap of 10
feet between plots E/F (which we call columns 5/6).
</p>
<p>Data was collected for 4 crops. Two other crops had poor germination
and were omitted.
</p>
<p>Field width: 10 plots * 33 feet + 8 gaps * 4 feet + 1 gap * 10 = 372 feet
</p>
<p>Field length: 11 blocks (plots) * 33 feet + 9 gaps * 7 feet + 1 gap * 14 feet = 440 feet
</p>
<p>Crop 1. Woolly Pyrol. Crop cut at flowering and weighed in pounds.
Note, woolly pyrol appears to be a bean also called black gram,
phaseolus mungo.
</p>
<p>Crop 2. Woolly Pyrol. Crop cut at flowering and weighed in pounds.
</p>
<p>Crop 3. Maize. Net weight of cobs in pounds. Source document also has
number of cobs.
</p>
<p>Crop 4. Yams. Weights in pounds. Source document has weight to 1/4
pound, which has here been rounded to the nearest pound. (Half pounds
were rounded to nearest even pound.) Source document also has number
of yams.
</p>
<p>Notes by Bradley.
</p>
<p>The edges of the field tended to be slightly higher yielding. Thought
to be due to the heavier cultivation which the edges recieve (p. 18).
</p>
<p>The plot in row 9, col 7 (9G in Bradley) is higher yielding than its
neighbors, thought to be the site of a saman tree dug up and burned
when the field was plotted. Bits of charcoal were still in the soil.
</p>
<p>Bradley also examined soil samples on selected plots and looked at
nutrients, moisture, texture, etc. The selected plots were 4
high-yielding plots and 4 low-yielding plots.  Little difference was
observed. Unexpectedly, yams gave higher yield on plots with more
compaction.
