<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The yields given in Harris (1920) (Practical universality...) are given for quarter-plots.
</p>
<p>The yields given in Harris (1920) (Permanence of ...) 
</p>
<p>The yields given in Harris (1928) are given for single plots.
</p>
<p>Field width: 2 plots * 317 ft  + 5 feet alley = 639 feet
</p>
<p>Field length: 23 plots * 23.3 feet = 536 feet
</p>
<p>All yields here are given in pound per plot.
The original data in Harris (1920) for the 1911 sugarbeet yields were
in tons/ac,  (Harris 1920, table 3 footnote), but these were converted
to pounds/plot for the purpose of this dataset.
</p>
<p>Harris (1928) shows a map of the location on page 16.
</p>
<p>Harris (1920):
</p>
<p>1911: In the spring of 1911 this field was laid out into 46 plots,
each measuring 23.5 by 317 feet and containing 0.17 acre, arranged in
two parallel series of 23 plots each. The two series of plots were
separated merely by a temporary irrigation ditch. In 1911 it was
planted to sugar beets.
</p>
<p>1912: In the spring of 1912 it was seeded to
alfalfa, and one cutting was harvested that year. This stand remained
on the ground during 1913 and 1914, when the entire field was
fall-plowed.
</p>
<p>1913: Three cuttings were made, but the third cutting
was lost in a heavy wind which scattered and mixed the crop before
weighings from the various plots could be made. The first cutting,
designated as alfalfa I, was made on plots one-half the original
size. The second cutting was harvested from plots one-quarter the
original size.
</p>
<p>1914: The first and second cuttings in 1914 were weighed for
plots one-quarter the original size&ndash;that is, 0.0425-acre plots&ndash;while
the third cutting was recorded for plots one-third the original
size. These furnish the data for alfalfa I, II, and III for 1914.
Total yields for the first and second cuttings in 1913 and 1914 and
for the first, second, and third cuttings in 1914 are also considered.
</p>
<p>1915: Ear corn.
</p>
<p>1916: Ear corn.
</p>
<p>1917: The fields were planted to oats, and records were made of grain,
straw, and total yield.
</p>
<p>1918: Silage corn was grown.
</p>
<p>1919: The land produced a crop of barley.
</p>
<p>1920: Silage corn
</p>
<p>1921 Alfalfa
</p>
<p>1922 Alfalfa, cutting 3
</p>
<p>1923 Alfalfa, cutting 1 and 3
</p>
<p>1914 Alfalfa, cutting 2 and 3
</p>
<p>Harris (1928):
</p>
<p>The southeast corner of Series II, the east series, is
about 80 feet from the main canal, and the southwest corner of Series
III is about 50 feet from Ouster Coulee. The main project canal
carries normally during the irrigation season about 400 second-feet of
water. The water surface in the canal is about 4 feet above the high
corner of the field. It is evident from surface conditions, as well as
from borings made between the canal and the field, that there is
extensive seepage from the canal into the subsoil of the field. The
volume of this seepage has been larger in recent years than it was in
the earlier years of the cropping experiments, probably because the
canal bank has been worn away by internal erosion, exposing a stratum
of sandy subsoil that underlies the canal and part of the field.
</p>
<p>Whereas in the earlier crops Series II was better for alfalfa, Series
III was better for alfalfa in the later period.  The writers feel
inclined to suggest that in the earlier experiments the height of the
water table had no harmful effect upon a deep-rooted crop such as
alfalfa.  It is quite possible that during drier periods the higher
water table actually favored alfalfa growth on Series II. The higher
water tables of recent years have probably had a deleterious
influence, which has been especially marked on Series II, where the
water apparently comes nearer to the surface than in Series III.
