<h3>Details</h3>

<p>1930 Experiment
</p>
<p>Beets were planted in rows 22 inches apart, thinned to 1 plant per
row. At harvest, the rows were marked into segments 33 feet long with
2 foot alleys between ends of plots.  The harvested area was 60 rows
350 feet long.
</p>
<p>Field width: 10 plots * 33 feet + 9 alleys * 2 feet = 348 feet
</p>
<p>Field length: 60 plots/rows * 22 in/row / 12 in/feet = 110 feet
</p>
<p>Planted in 1930.  Field conditions were uniform.  Beets were planted
in rows 22 inches apart.  After thinning, one beet was left in each
12-inch unit.  At harvest, the field was marked out in plot 33 feet
long, with a 2-foot alley between plots to minimize carryover from the
harvester.  A sample of 10 beets was taken uniformly (approximately
every third beet) and measured for sugar percentage and apparent
purity.  The beets were counted at weighing time and the yields were
calculated on the basis of 33 beets per plot.
</p>
<p>Immer found that aggregating the data from one row to two
resulted in a dramatic reduction in the standard error (for yield).
</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
</p>
<p>1931 Experiment
</p>
<p>Planted 13 May 1931. Field layout was the same as the previous year.
Unclear if the same land was used.
</p>
<p>Field width: 10 plots * 33 feet + 9 alleys * 2 feet = 348 feet
</p>
<p>Field length: 60 plots * 22 inches/row / 12 in/feet = 110 feet
</p>
<p>The data for this experiment were not published in Immer (1933), but
were deposited at Rothamsted.
</p>
<p>This data was made available with special help from the staff at
Rothamsted Research Library.
