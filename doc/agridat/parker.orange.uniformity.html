<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An orchard of naval oranges was planted in 1917 at the University of
California Citrus Experiment Station at Riverside.  The orchard was
maintained under uniform conditions for 10 years.
</p>
<p>Eight Washington Navel orange trees in a single row constituted a
plot. The planting distance is 20 feet between trees within the row
and 24 feet between rows.  Every other row was a guard row, so row 2
and row 4 were observational units, while row 3 was a guard row. For
example, from row 2 to row 4 is 2*24 = 48 feet.  Another way to think
of this is that each plot was 48 feet wide, but only the middle 24
feet was harvested.  At each end of the plot was one guard
tree. Including guard trees at the row ends, each row plot was 10
trees * 20 feet = 200 feet long.
</p>
<p>Field width (west-east) 10 plots * 200 feet =  2000 feet.
</p>
<p>Field length (north-south) 27 plots * 48 feet =  1296 feet.
</p>
<p>An investigation into the variability between plots included
systematic soil surveys, soil moisture, soil nitrates, and inspection
for differences in infestation of the citrus nematode. None of these
factors was considered to be the primary cause of the variations in
yield.
</p>
<p>After the 7 years of uniformity trials, different treatments were
applied to the plots.
</p>
<p>Parker et al. state that soil heterogeneity is considerable and
first-year yields are not predictive of future yields.
</p>
<p>Table 25 has mean top volume per tree for each plot in 1926.
Table 26 has mean area of trunk cross section.
