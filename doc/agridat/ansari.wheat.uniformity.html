<h2>
Uniformity trial of wheat
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uniformity trial of wheat in India in 1940.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("ansari.wheat.uniformity")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 768 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>row</code></dt><dd><p>row</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>col</code></dt><dd><p>column</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>yield</code></dt><dd><p>yield of grain per plot, in half-ounces</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An experiment was conducted at the Government Research Farm, Raya
(Muttra District), during the rainy season of 1939-40. 
</p>
<p>&quot;Wheat was sown over an area of 180 ft. x 243 ft. with 324 rows on a
field of average fertility. It had wheat during 1938-39 rabi and was
fallow during 1939-40 kharif. The seed was sown behind desi plough in
rows 9 inches apart, the length of each row being 180 feet&quot;.
</p>
<p>&quot;At the time of harvest, 18 rows on both sides and 10 feet at the end of
the field were discarded to eliminate border effects and an area of
160 feet x 216 feet with 288 rows was harvested in small units, each
being 2 feet 3 inches broad with three rows 20 feet long. There were 96
units across the rows and eight units along the rows. The total number
of unit plots thus obtained was 768. The yield of grain for each unit
plot was weighed and recorded separately and is given in the appendix.&quot;
</p>
<p>Field width: 96 plots * 2.25 feet = 216 feet.
</p>
<p>Field length: 8 plots * 20 feet = 160 feet.
</p>
<p>Comment: There seems to be a strong cyclical patern to the fertility gradient.
&quot;History of the field reveals no explanation for this phenomenon, as an average
field usually found on the farm was selected for the trial.&quot;
</p>
