<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Switchback experiment on dairy cattle, milk yield for two treatments
</p>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("brandt.switchback")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 30 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>group</code></dt><dd><p>group: A,B</p>

<dt><code>cow</code></dt><dd><p>cow, 10 levels</p>

<dt><code>trt</code></dt><dd><p>treatment, 2 levels</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>period</code></dt><dd><p>period, 3 levels</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>yield</code></dt><dd><p>milk yield, pounds</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In this experiment, 10 cows were selected from the Iowa State College
Holstein-Friesian herd and divided into two equal groups. Care was
taken to have the groups as nearly equal as possible with regard to
milk production, stage of gestation, body weight, condition and
age. These cows were each given 10 pounds of timothy hay and 30 pounds
of corn silage daily but were fed different grain mixtures. Treatment
T1, then, consisted of feeding a grain mixture of 1 part of corn and
cob meal to 1 part of ground oats, while treatment T2 consisted of
feeding a grain mixture of 4 parts corn and cob meal, 4 parts of
ground oats and 3 parts of gluten feed. The three treatment periods
covered 105 days &ndash; three periods of 35 days each. The yields for the
first 7 days of each period were not considered because of the
possible effect of the transition from one treatment to the other. The
data, together with sums and differences which aid in the calculations
incidental to testing, are given in table 2.
</p>
<p>It seems safe to conclude that the inclusion of gluten feed in the
grain mixture fed in a timothy hay ration to Holstein-Friesian cows
increased the production of milk. The average increase was 21.7 pounds
per cow for a 28-day period.
