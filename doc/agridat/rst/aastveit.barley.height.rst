      The 'aastveit.barley.height' dataframe has 135 observations on the
      following 3 variables.

      ``year``
         year, 9 years spanning from 1974 to 1982

      ``gen``
         genotype, 15 levels

      ``height``
         height (cm)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Experiments were conducted at As, Norway.

      The ``height`` dataframe contains average plant height (cm) of 15
      varieties of barley in each of 9 years.

      The growth season of each year was divided into eight periods from
      sowing to harvest. Because the plant stop growing about 20 days
      after ear emergence, only the first 6 periods are included here.
