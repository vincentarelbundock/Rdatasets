         :name: format

      A data frame with 612 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``isle``
         island, 2 levels

      ``site``
         site

      ``block``
         block

      ``plot``
         plot, numeric

      ``trt``
         treatment factor combining N,P,K

      ``ears``
         number of ears harvested

      ``yield``
         yield in kilograms

      ``N``
         nitrogen fertilizer level

      ``P``
         phosphorous fertilizer level

      ``K``
         potassium fertilizer level

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Antigua is a coral island in the Caribbean with sufficient level
      land for experiments and a semi-arid climate, while St. Vincent is
      volcanic and level areas are uncommon, but the rainfall can be
      seasonally heavy.

      There are 8-9 sites on each island.

      Plots were 16 feet by 18 feet. A central area 12 feet by 12 feet
      was harvested and recorded.

      The number of ears harvested was only recorded on the isle of
      Antigua.

      The actual amounts of N, P, and K are not given. Only 0, 1, 2, 3.

      The digits of the treatment represent the levels of nitrogen,
      phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer, respectively.

      The TEAN site suffered damage from goats on plot 27, 35 and 36.

      The LFAN site suffered damage from cattle on one boundaryâ€“plots 9,
      18, 27, 36.
