      This experiment was a repeat of the classic experiment by Mercer
      and Hall.

      Conducted at State Research Farm, Werribee, Victoria, Australia.

      Planted 1926. Harvested 1927. An acre of land was selected. Each
      plot had one double-sown row.

      Each plot was 30 x 20 links. The whole experiment was 300 x 320
      links.

      Near the west edge, a strip was damaged by cart tracks and
      excluded.

      The field was marked into quarters and one quarter was subdivided
      and harvested at a time.

      Each quarter was cut into 5 strips of 8 plots.

      Field length: 16 plots \* 20 links = 320 links (211 feet).

      Field width: 10 plots \* 30 links = 300 links (197 feet).

      Note: It is not clear how a strip "a few yards wide" could be
      omitted and yet the dimensions of the whole area still be 300 x
      320 links.

      Since the omitted strip is about 1/3 the width of a plot, we
      (agridat authors) decided to ignore the omitted strip.

      This electronic data was manually typed from the source on
      2023-04-12. Summary statistics of this electronic data differ
      slightly from the summaries in Forster, indicating possible typos
      or rounding of the printed yield values in the paper. Values were
      checked by hand and match the paper.
