         site factor

      ``year``
         year, 1979-1982

      ``yor``
         year of release, 1860-1982

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Twenty-eight of the most significant wheat cultivars of the past
      century in Western Australia, were grown in 20 field trials over 4
      years in the Central and Eastern wheat-belt of Australia.

      At the Wongan Hills site there were separate early and late sown
      trials in 1979 and 1980. Later sowing dates generally have lower
      yields.

      Note: Although not indicated by the original paper, it may be that
      the Merredin site in 1979 also had early/late sowing dates.
