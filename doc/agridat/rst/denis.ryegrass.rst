         :name: description

      Plant strength of perennial ryegrass in France for 21 genotypes at
      7 locations.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 147 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``gen``
         genotype, 21 levels

      ``loc``
         location, 7 levels

      ``strength``
         average plant strength \* 100

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      INRA conducted a breeding trial in western France with 21
      genotypes at 7 locations. The observed data is 'strength' averaged
      over 7-10 plants per plot and three plots per location (after
      adjusting for blocking effects). Each plant was scored on a scale
      0-9.

      The original data had a value of 86.0 for genotype G1 at location
      L4â€“this was replaced by an additive estimated value of 361.2 as in
      Gower and Hand (1996).
