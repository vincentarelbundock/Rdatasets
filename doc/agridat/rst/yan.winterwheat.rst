      .. rubric:: Multi-environment trial of winter wheat in Ontario
         :name: multi-environment-trial-of-winter-wheat-in-ontario

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Yield of 18 varieties of winter wheat grown at 9 environments in
      Ontario in 1993.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 162 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``gen``
         genotype

      ``env``
         environment

      ``yield``
         yield in metric tons per hectare

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The yield is the mean of several reps, measured in metric tons per
      hectare.

      This data has often been used to illustrate GGE biplots.
