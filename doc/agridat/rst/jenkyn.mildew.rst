      Yields from treatment for mildew control

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 38 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``plot``
         plot number

      ``trt``
         treatment factor, 4 levels

      ``block``
         block factor, 9 levels

      ``yield``
         grain yield, tons/ha

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      There were four spray treatments: 0 (none), 1 (early), 2 (late), R
      (repeated).

      Each treatment occurs once between each of the 9 ordered pairs of
      the other treatments.

      The first and last plot are not assigned to a block.
