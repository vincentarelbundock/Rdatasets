Corn borer control by application of fungal spores.
---------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Corn borer control by application of fungal spores.

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 60 observations on the following 4 variables.

``block``
   block, 15 levels

``trt``
   treatment, 4 levels

``count1``
   count of borers on August 18

``count2``
   count of borers on October 19

Details
~~~~~~~

Experiment conducted in 1935, Ottawa. European corn borer infestation
was established by application of egg masses to plants. Treatments were
applied on July 8 and July 19 at two levels, 0 and 40 grams per acre.
The number of borers per plot were counted on Aug 18 and Oct 19.
