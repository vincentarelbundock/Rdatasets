      Corn borer control by application of fungal spores.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 60 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``block``
         block, 15 levels

      ``trt``
         treatment, 4 levels

      ``count1``
         count of borers on August 18

      ``count2``
         count of borers on October 19

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Experiment conducted in 1935, Ottawa. European corn borer
      infestation was established by application of egg masses to
      plants. Treatments were applied on July 8 and July 19 at two
      levels, 0 and 40 grams per acre. The number of borers per plot
      were counted on Aug 18 and Oct 19.
