         :name: description

      Multi-environment trial of wheat, conventional and semi-dwarf
      varieties, 7 locs with low/high fertilizer levels.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 168 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``gen``
         genotype

      ``loc``
         location

      ``nitro``
         nitrogen fertilizer, low/high

      ``yield``
         yield (g/m^2)

      ``type``
         type factor, conventional/semi-dwarf

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Conducted in U.K. in 1975. Each loc had three reps, two nitrogen
      treatments.

      Locations were Begbroke, Boxworth, Crafts Hill, Earith, Edinburgh,
      Fowlmere, Trumpington.

      At the two highest-yielding locations, Earith and Edinburgh, yield
      was \_lower\_ for the high-nitrogen treatment. Blackman et al. say
      "it seems probable that effects on development and structure of
      the crop were responsible for the reductions in yield at high
      nitrogen".
