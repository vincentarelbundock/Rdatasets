         data("besag.checks")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 364 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``yield``
         yield, units of 10g

      ``row``
         row

      ``col``
         column

      ``gen``
         genotype/variety

      This data was used by Besag to show the spatial variation in a
      field experiment, but Besag did not use the data for any analysis.

      Yields of winter wheat varieties (Bounty and Huntsman) at the
      Plant Breeding Institute, Cambridge, in 1980. These data are the
      'checks' genotypes in a larger variety trial.

      There is a column of checks, then five columns of new varieties.
      Repeat.

      Plot dimensions approx 1.5 by 4.5 metres

      Field length: 52 rows \* 4.5 m = 234 m

      Field width: 31 columns \* 1.5 m = 46.5

      Electronic version of data supplied by David Clifford.
