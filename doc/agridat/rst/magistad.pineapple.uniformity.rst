      Field 19. Kunia. Harvested 1932.

      "In this field, harvested in 1932, there were four rows per bed. A
      300-foot bed was divided into four equal parts to form plats 1, 2,
      3, and 4. The third [sic, second] bed from this was similarly
      divided to form plats 5 to 8, inclusive. In the same manner plats
      9 to 24 were formed. In this way 24 plats each 75 feet long and 1
      bed wide were formed." Page 635: "the smallest plats are 75 by 6.5
      feet".

      Field length: 4 plats \* 75 feet = 300 feet

      Field width: 6 plats \* 6.5 feet = 39 feet

      Field 82. Pearl City.

      "Eight beds, each separated by two beds, were selected and
      harvested. Beds were 8 feet center to center. Each bed was divided
      into three plats 76 feet long." The columns which have data are
      bed 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22

      Note: Layout of plats into rows/columns assumes the same pattern
      as field 19.

      Field length: 3 plats \* 76 feet = 228 feet

      Field width: 22 plats \* 8 feet = 176 feet.

      Field 21. Kahuku.

      "In field 21, Kahuku, the experimental plan was of the Latin
      square type, having five beds of five plats each. The beds were
      7.5 feet center to center. Each plat was approximately 60 feet
      long and each third bed was selected and harvested." Note: Layout
      of plats into rows/columns assumes the same pattern as field 19.

      Field lenght: 5 plats \* 60 feet = 300 feet

      Field width: 13 plats \* 7.5 feet = 97.5 feet

      Field 1. Kunia.

      "This experiment was another Latin square test having eight plats
      in each column and eight plats in each row. It was harvested in
      1930. Each plat consisted of two beds 150 feet long. Beds were 6
      feet center to center and consisted of three rows each. The entire
      experimental area occupied 2.85 acres."

      Field length: 8 plats \* 150 feet = 1200 feet

      Field width: 8 plats \* 2 beds \* 6 feet = 96 feet

      Total area: 1200*96/43560=2.64 acres
