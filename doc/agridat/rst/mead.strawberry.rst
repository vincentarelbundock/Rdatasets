      RCB experiment of strawberry

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 32 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``row``
         row

      ``col``
         column

      ``block``
         block, 4 levels

      ``gen``
         genotype, 8 levels

      ``yield``
         yield, pounds

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      A hedge along the right side (column 8) caused shading and lower
      yields.

      R. Mead said (in a discussion of the Besag & Higdon paper), "the
      blocks defined (as given to me by the experimenter) are the entire
      horizontal rows...the design of the trial is actually (and
      unrecognized by me also) a checker-board of eight half-blocks with
      two groups of split-plot varieties".

      The two sub-groups of genotypes are G, V, R1, F and Re, M, E, P.

      Unknown, but prior to 1968 according to Besag. Probably via R.
