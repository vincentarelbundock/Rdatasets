         nitrogen fertilizer, kg/ha

      ``topo``
         topographic factor

      ``bv``
         brightness value (proxy for low organic matter content)

      Corn yield and nitrogen fertilizer treatment with field
      characteristics for the Las Rosas farm, Rio Cuarto, Cordoba,
      Argentina.

      Data has 6 nitro treatments, 3 reps, in strips.

      Data collected using yield monitor, for harvests in 1999 and 2001.

      The points within each long strip have been averaged so that the
      distance between points \_within\_ a strip is the same as the
      distance \_between\_ strips (9.8 meters).

      The topographic factor a factor with levels W = West slope, HT =
      Hilltop, E = East slope, LO = Low East.

      The 'rep' factor in this data was added by hand and did not appear
      in the original data.

      Slightly different levels of nitrogen were used in the two years,
      so the nitrogen factor 'nf' was created to have common levels
      across years.

      Published descriptions of the data describe the experiment design
      as having randomized nitrogen treatments. The nitrogen treatments
      were randomized within one rep, but the same randomization was
      used in the other two reps.

      Anselin et al. used corn grain price of $6.85/quintal and nitrogen
      cost of $0.4348/kg.

      The corners of the field in 1999 are:

      https://www.google.com/maps/place/-33.05229635,-63.84181819

      Anselin et al. found a significant response to nitrogen for slope.
      However, Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2002) found that slope
      position was NOT significant in 2001.
