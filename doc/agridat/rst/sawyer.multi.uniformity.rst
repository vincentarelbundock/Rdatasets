      An experiment conducted at Rothamsted, England, in 1925-1927, in
      Sawyers Field.

      Row 6, column 1 was not planted in any year.

      1925: Wheat was harvested

      Row 1, column 1 had partially missing data for the wheat values in
      1925 and was not used in the Rothamsted summary statistics on page
      155.

      1926: Swedes were harvested

      1927: Oats were harvested

      Note the summaries statistics at the bottom of the page in each
      report are calibrated to ACRES.

      Field width: 8 plots \* 22 feet = 528 feet

      Field length: 6 plots \* 22 feet = 396 feet

      The field is 8 plots wide, 6 plots long. The plots are drawn in
      the source documents as squares .098 acres each (1 chain = 66 feet
      on each side).

      Eden & Maskell (page 165) say the field was clover, and ploughed
      in the autumn of 1924. The field was laid out uniformly in lands
      of one chain width and each plot width made to coincide with the
      land width from ridge to ridge. The length of each plot was also
      one chain and from the point of view of yield data the trial
      comprised 47 plots in 8x6 except that the run of the hedge only
      allowed a rank of five plots at one of the ends.
