      Fungus infection in varieties of wheat

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 400 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``bunt``
         bunt factor, 20 levels

      ``pct``
         percent infected

      ``rep``
         rep factor, 2 levels

      ``gen``
         genotype factor, 10 levels

      Note: Salmon (1938) gives results for all 69 types of bunt, not
      just the 20 shown in the paper.

      H. A. Rodenhiser and C. S. Holton (1937) say that races from two
      different species of bunt were used, Tilletia tritici and T.
      levis.

      This data gives the results with 20 types of bunt (fungus) for
      winter wheat varieties at Kearneysville, W. Va., in 1935.
      Altogether there were 69 types of bunt included in the experiment,
      of which the 20 in this data are representative. Each type of
      wheat was grown in a short row (5 to 8 feet), the seed of which
      had been innoculated with the spores of bunt. The entire seeding
      was then repeated in the same order.

      Infection was recorded as a percentage of the total number of
      heads counted at or near harvest. The number counted was seldom
      less than 200 and sometimes more than 400 per row.
