         :name: description

      Phenotypic and genotypic data for a barley population of Steptoe x
      Morex. There were 150 doubled haploid crosses, evaluated at 223
      markers. Phenotypic data wascollected on 8 traits at 16
      environments.

      As described by Hayes et al (1993), a population of 150 barley
      doubled haploid (DH) lines was developed by the Oregon State
      University Barley Breeding Program for the North American Barley
      Genome Mapping Project. The parentage of the population is Steptoe
      / Morex.

      Steptoe is the dominant feed barley in the northwestern U.S.

      Morex is the spring U.S. malting quality standard.

      Seed from a single head of each parent was used to create the F1,
      from which a set of 150 lines was developed.

      Phenotypic values for the parents Steptoe and Morex are here:
      https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/parental_values.html

      There are 16 locations, The average across locations is in column
      17. Not all traits were collected at every location. At each
      location, all 150 lines were included in block 1, a random subset
      of 50 lines was used in block 2.

      The traits are: Alpha Amylase (20 Deg Units), Diastatic Power (Deg
      Units), Heading Date (Julian Days), Lodging (percent), Malt
      Extract (percent), Grain Protein (percent), Grain Yield (Mt/Ha).

      Phenotypic values of the 150 lines in the F1 population are here:
      https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/phenotypes.html

      Each trait is in a different file, in which each block of numbers
      represents one location.

      The 223-markers Steptoe/Morex base map is here:
      https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/smbasev2.map

      The data for these markers on the 150 lines is
      https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/smbasev2.mrk

      These were hand-assembled (e.g. marker distances were cumulated to
      marker positions) into a .csv file which was then imported into R
      using ``qtl::read.cross``. The class was manually changed from
      c('bc','cross') to c('dh','cross').

      The marker data is coded as A = Steptoe, B = Morex, - = missing.

      The pedigrees for the 150 lines are found here:
      https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/pedigrees.html
