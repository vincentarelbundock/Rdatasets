      A data frame with 152 observations on the following 6 variables.

      ``gen``
         genotype / variety

      ``height``
         plot height, cm

      ``yield``
         plot yield, g

      ``row``
         row / block

      ``rep``
         replicate factor

      ``col``
         column

      Field beans of regular height were grown beside shorter varieties.
      In each block, each variety occurred once as a left-side neighbor
      and once as a right-side neighbor of every variety (including
      itself). Border plots were placed at the ends of each block. Each
      block with 38 adjacent plots. Each plot was one row, 3 meters long
      with 50 cm spacing between rows. No gaps between plots. Spacing
      between plants was 6.7 cm. Four blocks (rows) were used, each with
      six replicates.

      Plot yield and height was recorded.

      Kempton and Lockwood used models that adjusted yield according to
      the difference in height of neighboring plots.

      Field length: 4 plots \* 3m = 12m

      Field width: 38 plots \* 0.5 m = 19m
