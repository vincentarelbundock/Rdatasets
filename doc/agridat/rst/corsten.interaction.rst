         :name: multi-environment-trial-of-corn

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data is the yield (kg/acre) of 20 genotypes of corn at 7
      locations.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 140 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``gen``
         genotype, 20 levels

      ``loc``
         location, 7 levels

      ``yield``
         yield, kg/acre

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data is used by Corsten & Denis (1990) to illustrate two-way
      clustering by minimizing the interaction sum of squares.

      In their paper, the labels on the location dendrogram have a
      slight typo. The order of the loc labels shown is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
      The correct order of the loc labels is 1 2 4 5 6 7 3.
