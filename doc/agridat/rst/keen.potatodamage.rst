      Experiments performed at Wageningen, Netherlands.

      Potatoes can be damaged by the lifter. In this experiment, eight
      types of lifting rod were compared. Two energy levels, six
      genotypes/varieties and three weight classes were used. Most
      combinations of treatments involved about 20 potato tubers. Tubers
      were rated as undamaged (D1) to severely damaged (D4).

      The main interest is in differences between rods, and not in
      interactions. The other factors (besides rod) were introduced to
      create variety in experimental conditions and are not of interest.

      Keen and Engle estimated the following rod effects.

      # Rod: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

      # Effect: 0 -1.26 -0.42 0.55 -1.50 -1.85 -1.76 -2.09
