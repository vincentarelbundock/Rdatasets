      Uniformity trial of wheat at Aberdeen, Idaho, 1927.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 1500 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``row``
         row

      ``col``
         column (series)

      ``yield``
         yield in grams per plot

      Yield trial conducted in 1927 near Aberdeen, Idaho. The crop was
      Federation wheat (C.I. no 4734). Plots were seeded on April 18
      with a drill that sowed eight rows at a time. Individual rows were
      harvested in August and threshed with a small nursery thresher.
      Some authors recommend analyzing the square root of the yields.

      Rows were 15 feet long, 1 foot apart.

      Field width: 12 columns \* 15 feet = 180 feet wide.

      Field length: 125 rows \* 12 in = 125 feet
