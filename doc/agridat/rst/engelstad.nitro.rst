      Corn yield response to nitrogen fertilizer for a single variety of
      corn at two locations over five years

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 60 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``loc``
         location, 2 levels

      ``year``
         year, 1962-1966

      ``nitro``
         nitrogen fertilizer kg/ha

      ``yield``
         yield, quintals/ha

      Corn yield response to nitrogen fertilizer for a single variety of
      corn at two locations in Tennessee over five years. The yield data
      is the mean of 9 replicates. The original paper fits quadratic
      curves to the data. Schabenberger and Pierce fit multiple models
      including linear plateau. The example below fits a quadratic
      plateau for one year/loc. In the original paper, the 1965 and 1966
      data for the Knoxville location was not used as it appeared that
      the response due to nitrogen was minimal in 1965 and nonexistant
      in 1966. The economic optimum can be found by setting the tangent
      equal to the ratio of (fertilizer price)/(grain price).
