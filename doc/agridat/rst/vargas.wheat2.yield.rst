         covariates
         :name: multi-environment-trial-of-wheat-with-environmental-covariates

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The yield of 8 wheat genotypes was measured in 21 low-humidity
      environments. Each environment had 13 covariates recorded.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Grain yields (kg/ha) for 8 wheat genotypes at 21 low-humidity
      environments grown during 1990-1994. The data is
      environment-centered and genotype-centered. The rows and columns
      of the GxE matrix have mean zero. The locations of the experiments
      were:
