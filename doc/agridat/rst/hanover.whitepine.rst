      Mating crosses of white pine trees

         data("hanover.whitepine")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 112 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``rep``
         replicate

      ``female``
         female parent

      ``male``
         male parent

      ``length``
         epicotyl length, cm

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Four male (pollen parent) White Pine trees were mated to seven
      female trees and 2654 progeny were grown in four replications, one
      plot per mating in each replication. Parent trees were sourced
      from Idaho, USA. The data are plot means of epicotyl length.

      Becker (1984) used these data to demonstrate the calculation of
      heritability.
