      Grown at West Virginia Experiment Station in 1925 & 1926.

      Soy forage hay:

      In 1925 the crop was harvested for forage, 42 rows, each 200 feet
      long. Yields of 8-foot plats recorded to the nearest 0.1 tons.

      Field width: 42 plots \* 30 in / 12in/ft = 105 ft

      Field length: 24 plots \* 8 feet = 192 feet + border = total 200
      feet.

      Note, the hay data in Odland & Garber is measured in 0.1 tons, but
      has been converted to tons here.

      Soy beans:

      Soybeans were planted in rows 30 inches apart. In 1926 the crop
      was harvested for seed, 55 rows, each 232 feet long. Yields of
      8-foot plats were recorded. In 1926, data for the last row on page
      96 seems to be missing.

      Field width: 55 plots \* 30 in / 12in/ft = 137.5 feet

      Field length: 28 plots \* 8 feet = 224 feet + border = total 232
      feet.

      Odland and Garber provide no agronomic context for the yield
      variation.
