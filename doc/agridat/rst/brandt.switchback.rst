      A data frame with 30 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``group``
         group: A,B

      ``cow``
         cow, 10 levels

      ``trt``
         treatment, 2 levels

      ``period``
         period, 3 levels

      ``yield``
         milk yield, pounds

      In this experiment, 10 cows were selected from the Iowa State
      College Holstein-Friesian herd and divided into two equal groups.
      Care was taken to have the groups as nearly equal as possible with
      regard to milk production, stage of gestation, body weight,
      condition and age. These cows were each given 10 pounds of timothy
      hay and 30 pounds of corn silage daily but were fed different
      grain mixtures. Treatment T1, then, consisted of feeding a grain
      mixture of 1 part of corn and cob meal to 1 part of ground oats,
      while treatment T2 consisted of feeding a grain mixture of 4 parts
      corn and cob meal, 4 parts of ground oats and 3 parts of gluten
      feed. The three treatment periods covered 105 days â€“ three periods
      of 35 days each. The yields for the first 7 days of each period
      were not considered because of the possible effect of the
      transition from one treatment to the other. The data, together
      with sums and differences which aid in the calculations incidental
      to testing, are given in table 2.

      It seems safe to conclude that the inclusion of gluten feed in the
      grain mixture fed in a timothy hay ration to Holstein-Friesian
      cows increased the production of milk. The average increase was
      21.7 pounds per cow for a 28-day period.
