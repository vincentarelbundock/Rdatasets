      Sugar beet yields with competition effects

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 114 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``gen``
         Genotype factor, 36 levels plus Border

      ``col``
         Column

      ``block``
         Row/Block

      ``wheel``
         Position relative to wheel tracks

      ``yield``
         Root yields, kg/plot

      This sugar-beet trial was conducted in 1979.

      Single-row plots, 12 m long, 0.5 m between rows. Each block is
      made up of all 36 genotypes laid out side by side. Guard/border
      plots are at each end. Root yields were collected.

      Wheel tracks are located between columns 1 and 2, and between
      columns 5 and 6, for each set of six plots. Each genotype was
      randomly allocated once to each pair of plots (1,6), (2,5), (3,4)
      across the three reps. Wheel effect were not significant in
      \_this\_ trial.

      Field width: 18m + 1m guard rows = 19m

      Field length: 3 blocks \* 12m + 2*0.5m spacing = 37m Retrieved
