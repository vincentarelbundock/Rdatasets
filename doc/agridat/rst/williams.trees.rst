      Multi-environment trial of trees, height / survival of 37 species
      at 6 sites in Thailand

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 222 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``env``
         Environment factor, 6 levels

      ``gen``
         Genetic factor, 37 levels

      ``height``
         Height (cm)

      ``survival``
         Survival percentage

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Planted in 1985 at six sites in Thailand. RCB with 3 reps. The
      data here is the mean of the three reps. Plots were 5 meters
      square with spacing 2m x 2m. Measurements collected at 24 months.
      The ``gen`` column in the data is actually *seedlot*, as some tree
      species have multiple seed lots. The trees are mostly acacia and
      eucalyptus.
