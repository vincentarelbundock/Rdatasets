      Four replicates of 19 released cultivars, 35 experimental wheat
      lines and 2 additional triticale lines were laid out in a 22 row
      by 11 column rectangular array of plots. The varieties were
      allocated to the plots using a randomised complete block (RCB)
      design. Each plot was sown in four rows 4.3 m long and 0.3 m
      apart. Plots were trimmed down to 2.4 m in length before harvest.
      The orientation of the plots is not clear from the paper, but the
      data in Littel et al are given in meters and make the orientation
      clear.

      Field length: 11 plots \* 4.3 m = 47.3 m

      Field width: 22 plots \* 1.2 m = 26.4 m

      All plots with missing data are coded as being gen = "Lancer".
      (For ASREML, missing plots need to be included for spatial
      analysis and the level of 'gen' needs to be one that is already in
      the data.)

      These data were first analyzed by Stroup et al (1994) and
      subsequently by Littell et al (1996, page 321), Pinheiro and Bates
      (2000, page 260), and Butler et al (2004).

      This version of the data give the yield in bushels per acre. The
      yield values published in Stroup et al (1994) are expressed in
      kg/ha. For wheat, 1 bu/ac = 67.25 kg/ha.

      Some of the gen names are different in Stroup et al (1994).
      (Sometimes an experimental genotype is given a new name when it is
      released for commercial use.) At a minimum, the following
      differences in gen names should be noted:

      ========== ============
      stroup.nin Stroup et al
      NE83498    Rawhide
      KS831374   Karl
      ========== ============

      Some published versions of the data use long/lat instead of
      col/row. To obtain the correct value of 'long', multiply 'col' by
      1.2. To obtain the correct value of 'lat', multiply 'row' by 4.3.

      Relatively low yields were clustered in the northwest corner,
      which is explained by a low rise in this part of the field,
      causing increased exposure to winter kill from wind damage and
      thus depressed yield. The genotype 'Buckskin' is a known superior
      variety, but was disadvantaged by assignment to unfavorable
      locations within the blocks.

      Note that the figures in Stroup 2002 claim to be based on this
      data, but the number of rows and columns are both off by 1 and the
      positions of Buckskin as shown in Stroup 2002 do not appear to be
      quite right.
