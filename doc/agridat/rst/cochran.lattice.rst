      A data frame with 80 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``y``
         percent of affected flower buds

      ``rep``
         replicate

      ``row``
         row

      ``col``
         column

      ``trt``
         treatment factor

      The experiment is a balanced lattice square with 16 treatments in
      a 4x4 layout in each of 5 replicates. The treatments were applied
      to cotton plants. Each plot was ten rows wide by 70 feet long
      (about 1/18 of an acre). (Estimated plot width is 34.5 feet.) Data
      were collected from the middle 4 rows. The data are the
      percentages of squares showing attack by boll weevils. A 'square'
      is the name given to a young flower bud.

      The plot orientation is not clear.
