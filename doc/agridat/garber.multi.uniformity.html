<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The experiments were conducted at the West Virginia Agricultural
Experiment Station at Maggie, West Virginia.
</p>
<p>Note, Garber et al (1926) and Garber et al (1931) describe uniformity
trials from the same field, but the experimental plot numbers in the
two papers are different, indicating different parts of the field.
</p>
<p>The data from 1923 and 1924 are given in Garber (1926).
</p>
<p>The data from 1927, 1928, 1929 are given in Garber (1931).
</p>
<p>All the data were given in the source papers as relative deviations
from mean, but have been converted to absolute yields for this
package.
</p>
<p>First paper: Garber (1926)
</p>
<p>Each plot was 68 feet x 21 feet. After discarding a 3.5 foot border on
all sides, the harvested area was 61 feet x 14 feet. The plots were
laid out in double series with a 14-foot roadway between the
plots. For example, columns 1 &amp; 2 were side-by-side, then 14 foot
road, then columns 3 &amp; 4, then 14 foot road, then columns 5 &amp; 6.
</p>
<p>Note: The orientation of the plots (68x21) is an educated guess.
If the orientation was 21x68, the field would be extremely narrow and
long.
</p>
<p>Field width: 6 plots * 68 feet + 14 ft/roadway * 2 = 436 feet
</p>
<p>Field length: 45 plots * 21 feet/plot = 945 feet
</p>
<p>Garber said: &quot;Plots 211 to 214, and 261 to 264, [note, these are rows
11-14, columns 5-6] inclusive, were eliminated from this study because
of the fact that a few years ago a straw stack had stood on or in the
vicinity...which undoubtedly accounts for the relatively high yields
on plots 261 to 264, inclusive.&quot;
</p>
<p>1923 oat hay, yield in pounds per acre
</p>
<p>The data for the oat hay was given in Table 5 as mean-subtracted
yields in pounds per acre for each plot. The oat
yield in row 22, column 5 was given as +59.7.  This is obviously
incorrect, since the negative yields all end in '.7' and positive
yields all ended in '.3'.  We used -59.7 as the centered yield value
and added the mean of 1883.7 (p. 259) to all centered yields to obtain
absolute yields in pounds per acre.
</p>
<p>1924 wheat, yield in bushels per acre
</p>
<p>The data for the wheat was given in bushels per acre, expressed as
deviations from the mean yield (15.6 bu).
We added the mean to all plot data.
</p>
<p>Second paper: Garber (1926)
</p>
<p>1927 corn, 1928 oats, 1929 wheat
</p>
<p>The field is 10 plots wide, 84 plots tall.
</p>
<p>Field width: 10 plots * 68 feet + 4 roads * 14 feet = 736 feet.
</p>
<p>Field length: 84 plots * 21 feet + 3 roads * 14 feet = 1806 feet.
