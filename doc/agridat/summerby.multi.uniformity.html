<h2>
Uniformity trial of maize, oat, alfalfa, mangolds
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uniformity trial of maize, oat, alfalfa, mangolds
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("summerby.multi.uniformity")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2600 observations on the following 6 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>col</code></dt><dd><p>column ordinate</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>row</code></dt><dd><p>row ordinate</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>yield</code></dt><dd><p>yield</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>range</code></dt><dd><p>range (block in field)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>year</code></dt><dd><p>year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>crop</code></dt><dd><p>crop</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that the plots for each range are the same across years.
For example the plots in range R2 are the same in 1922, 1923, 1924,
1925.
</p>
<p>Grown at Macdonald College, Quebec.
Four ranges of land each 760 x 100 links were used.
In years 1922-1926, all crops were harvested in 20 link by 20 links
plots. 
</p>
<p>In oats, the yields are for cleaned grain.
In mangolds and alfalfa, the yields of dry matter were calculated.
In maize, the green weights of fodder were obtained.
In 1925, range R3 oats were damaged by birds.
In 1927, range R4 oats were lodges and not harvested.
In 1924 range R5 had some flooding and is considered 'inadvisable' for use.
In 1914 range R3 oat yield was variable, perhaps from poor germination.
Data are included here for completeness, but should perhaps not be included.
</p>
<p>The row numbers in this data are based on the figure on page 13 of Summerby.
Row 1 is at the bottom. There appears to be approximately a blank row between ranges.
</p>
<p>The paper by Summerby has more year/range combinations, but those
plots are 20 links by 100 links and are only a single plot wide.
</p>
<p>These data were converted from PDF to png images, then OCR converted
to text, then hand-checked by K.Wright.
