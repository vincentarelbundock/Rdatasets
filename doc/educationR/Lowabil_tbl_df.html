<h2>Reading skills of 24 matched low ability students</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset, Lowabil_tbl_df, is a tibble containing data on the reading skills of 24
students with low abilities, who were matched based on certain characteristics. The dataset
compares the performance of the students in two different groups: the experimental group and the control group.
This can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment in improving reading skills.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

</dd>
<dt>experiment</dt><dd><p>Reading score for students in the experimental group (integer).</p>
</dd>
<dt>control</dt><dd><p>Reading score for students in the control group (integer).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
