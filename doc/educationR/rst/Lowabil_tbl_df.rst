         :name: description

      This dataset, Lowabil_tbl_df, is a tibble containing data on the
      reading skills of 24 students with low abilities, who were matched
      based on certain characteristics. The dataset compares the
      performance of the students in two different groups: the
      experimental group and the control group. This can be used to
      evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention or treatment in
      improving reading skills.
