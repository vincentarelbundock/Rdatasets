      .. rubric:: Music Recognition Learning in Identical Twins
         :name: music-recognition-learning-in-identical-twins

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset, Music_tbl_df, is a tibble containing improvement
      scores for identical twins taught music recognition using two
      different techniques. Each pair of twins was taught using both
      methods, and the differences in their improvement scores were
      recorded.
