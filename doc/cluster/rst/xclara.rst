      .. rubric:: Bivariate Data Set with 3 Clusters
         :name: bivariate-data-set-with-3-clusters

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      An artificial data set consisting of 3000 points in 3 quite
      well-separated clusters.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(xclara)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 3000 observations on 2 numeric variables (named
      ``V1`` and ``V2``) giving the ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates of the
      points, respectively.

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      Our version of the ``xclara`` is slightly more rounded than the
      one from ``read.table("xclara.dat")`` and the relative difference
      measured by ``all.equal`` is ``1.15e-7`` for ``V1`` and
      ``1.17e-7`` for ``V2`` which suggests that our version has been
      the result of a ``options(digits = 7)`` formatting.

      Previously (before May 2017), it was claimed the three cluster
      were each of size 1000, which is clearly wrong. ``pam(*, 3)``
      gives cluster sizes of 899, 1149, and 952, which apart from seven
      “outliers” (or “mislabellings”) correspond to observation indices
      ``\{1:900\}``, ``\{901:2050\}``, and ``\{2051:3000\}``, see the
      example.
