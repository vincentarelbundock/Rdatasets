      ``longindex``
         Seed bank longevity

      ``durflow``
         Flowering duration

      ``height``
         Plant height, an ordered factor with levels ``1`` < ``2`` < ...
         < ``8``.

      ``begflow``
         Time of first flowering, an ordered factor with levels ``1`` <
         ``2`` < ``3`` < ``4`` < ``5`` < ``6`` < ``7`` < ``8`` < ``9``

      ``mycor``

      ``vegaer``
         aerial vegetative propagation, an ordered factor with levels
         ``0``\ never < ``1`` present but limited< ``2``\ important.

      ``vegsout``
         underground vegetative propagation, an ordered factor with 3
         levels identical to ``vegaer`` above.

      ``autopoll``

         ``4``.

      ``lign``
         a binary factor with levels ``0:1``, indicating if plant is
         woody.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Most of factor attributes are not disjunctive. For example, a
      plant can be usually pollinated by insects but sometimes
      self-pollination can occured.
