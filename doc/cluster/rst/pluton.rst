      .. rubric:: Isotopic Composition Plutonium Batches
         :name: isotopic-composition-plutonium-batches

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``pluton`` data frame has 45 rows and 4 columns, containing
      percentages of isotopic composition of 45 Plutonium batches.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(pluton)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Pu238
         the percentages of ``\ ^{238}Pu``, always less than 2 percent.

      Pu239
         the percentages of ``\ ^{239}Pu``, typically between 60 and 80
         percent (from neutron capture of Uranium, ``\ ^{238}U``).

      Pu240
         percentage of the plutonium 240 isotope.

      Pu241
         percentage of the plutonium 241 isotope.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Note that the percentage of plutonium~242 can be computed from the
      other four percentages, see the examples.

      In the reference below it is explained why it is very desirable to
      combine these plutonium patches in three groups of similar size.
