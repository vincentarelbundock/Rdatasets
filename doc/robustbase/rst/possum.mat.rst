      Possum diversity data: As issued from a study of the diversity of
      possum (arboreal marsupials) in the Montane ash forest
      (Australia), this dataset was collected in view of the management
      of hardwood forest to take conservation and recreation values, as
      well as wood production, into account.

      The study is fully described in the two references. The number of
      different species of arboreal marsupials (possum) was observed on
      151 different 3ha sites with uniform vegetation. For each site the
      nine variable measures (see below) were recorded. The problem is
      to model the relationship between ``diversity`` and these other
      variables.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(possumDiv, package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      Two different representations of the same data are available:

      ``possumDiv`` is a data frame of 151 observations of 9 variables,
      where the last two are factors, ``eucalyptus`` with 3 levels and
      ``aspect`` with 4 levels.

      ``possum.mat`` is a numeric (integer) matrix of 151 rows
      (observations) and 14 columns (variables) where the last seven
      ones are 0-1 dummy variables, three (``E.*``) are coding for the
      kind of ``eucalyptus`` and the last four are 0-1 coding for the
      ``aspect`` factor.

      The variables have the following meaning:

      Diversity
         main variable of interest is the number of different species of
         arboreal marsupial (possum) observed, with values in 0:5.

      Shrubs
         the number of shrubs.

      Stumps
         the number of cut stumps from past logging operations.

      Stags
         the number of stags (hollow-bearing trees).

      Bark
         bark index (integer) vector reflecting the quantity of
         decorticating bark.

      Habitat
         an integer score indicating the suitability of nesting and
         foraging habitat for Leadbeater's possum.

      BAcacia
         a numeric vector giving the basal area of acacia species.

      | 

      eucalyptus
         a 3-level ``factor`` specifying the species of eucalypt with
         the greatest stand basal area. This has the same information as
         the following three variables

      E.regnans
         0-1 indicator for Eucalyptus regnans

      E.delegatensis
         0-1 indicator for Eucalyptus deleg.

      E.nitens
         0-1 indicator for Eucalyptus nitens

      | 

      aspect
         a 4-level ``factor`` specifying the aspect of the site. It is
         the same information as the following four variables.

      NW-NE
         0-1 indicator

      NW-SE
         0-1 indicator

      SE-SW
         0-1 indicator

      SW-NW
         0-1 indicator
