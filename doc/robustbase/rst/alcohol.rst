      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The solubility of alcohols in water is important in understanding
      alcohol transport in living organisms. This dataset from
      (Romanelli et al., 2001) contains physicochemical characteristics
      of 44 aliphatic alcohols. The aim of the experiment was the
      prediction of the solubility on the basis of molecular
      descriptors.

      A data frame with 44 observations on the following 7 numeric
      variables.

      ``SAG``
         solvent accessible surface-bounded molecular volume.

      ``V``
         volume

      ``logPC``
         Log(PC); PC = octanol-water partitions coefficient

      ``P``
         polarizability

      ``RM``
         molar refractivity

      ``Mass``
         the mass

      ``logSolubility``
         ln(Solubility), the response.
