      .. rubric:: Modified Data on Wood Specific Gravity
         :name: modified-data-on-wood-specific-gravity

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The original data are from Draper and Smith (1966) and were used
      to determine the influence of anatomical factors on wood specific
      gravity, with five explanatory variables and an intercept. These
      data were contaminated by replacing a few observations with
      outliers.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(wood, package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 20 observations on the following 6 variables.

      x1, x2, x3, x4, x5
         explanatory “anatomical” wood variables.

      y
         wood specific gravity, the target variable.
