      .. rubric:: Heart Catherization Data
         :name: heart-catherization-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data set was analyzed by Weisberg (1980) and Chambers et al.
      (1983). A catheter is passed into a major vein or artery at the
      femoral region and moved into the heart. The proper length of the
      introduced catheter has to be guessed by the physician. The aim of
      the data set is to describe the relation between the catheter
      length and the patient's height (X1) and weight (X2).

      This data sets is used to demonstrate the effects caused by
      collinearity. The correlation between height and weight is so high
      that either variable almost completely determines the other.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(heart)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 12 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``height``
         Patient's height in inches

      ``weight``
         Patient's weights in pounds

      ``clength``
         Y: Catheter Length (in centimeters)

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      There are other ``heart`` datasets in other **R** packages,
      notably
      `survival <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival>`__, hence
      considering using ``package = "robustbase"``, see examples.
