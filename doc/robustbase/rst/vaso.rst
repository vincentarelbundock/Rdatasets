         :name: vaso-constriction-skin-data-set

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Finney's data on vaso constriction in the skin of the digits.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(vaso, package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 39 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``Volume``
         Inhaled volume of air

      ``Rate``
         Rate of inhalation

      ``Y``
         vector of 0 or 1 values.

      The data taken from Finney (1947) were obtained in a carefully
      controlled study in human physiology where a reflex “vaso
      constriction” may occur in the skin of the digits after taking a
      single deep breath. The response y is the occurence (y = 1) or
      non-occurence (y = 0) of vaso constriction in the skin of the
      digits of a subject after he or she inhaled a certain volume of
      air at a certain rate. The responses of three subjects are
      available. The first contributed 9 responses, the second
      contributed 8 responses, and the third contributed 22 responses.

      Although the data represent repeated measurements, an analysis
      that assumes independent observations may be applied, as claimed
      by Pregibon (1981).
