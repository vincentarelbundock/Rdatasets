      Data from a clinical trial of 59 patients with epilepsy (Breslow,
      1996) in order to illustrate diagnostic techniques in Poisson
      regression.

      A data frame with 59 observations on the following 11 variables.

      ``ID``
         Patient identification number

      ``Y1``
         Number of epilepsy attacks patients have during the first
         follow-up period

      ``Y2``
         Number of epilepsy attacks patients have during the second
         follow-up period

      ``Y3``
         Number of epilepsy attacks patients have during the third
         follow-up period

      ``Y4``
         Number of epilepsy attacks patients have during the forth
         follow-up period

      ``Base``
         Number of epileptic attacks recorded during 8 week period prior
         to randomization

      ``Age``
         Age of the patients

      ``Trt``
         a factor with levels ``placebo`` ``progabide`` indicating
         whether the anti-epilepsy drug Progabide has been applied or
         not

      ``Ysum``
         Total number of epilepsy attacks patients have during the four
         follow-up periods

      ``Age10``
         Age of the patients devided by 10

      ``Base4``
         Variable ``Base`` devided by 4

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Thall and Vail reported data from a clinical trial of 59 patients
      with epilepsy, 31 of whom were randomized to receive the
      anti-epilepsy drug Progabide and 28 of whom received a placebo.
      Baseline data consisted of the patient's age and the number of
      epileptic seizures recorded during 8 week period prior to
      randomization. The response consisted of counts of seizures
      occuring during the four consecutive follow-up periods of two
      weeks each.
