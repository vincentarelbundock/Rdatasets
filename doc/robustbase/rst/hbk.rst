      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Artificial Data Set generated by Hawkins, Bradu, and Kass (1984).
      The data set consists of 75 observations in four dimensions (one
      response and three explanatory variables). It provides a good
      example of the masking effect. The first 14 observations are
      outliers, created in two groups: 1–10 and 11–14. Only observations
      12, 13 and 14 appear as outliers when using classical methods, but
      can be easily unmasked using robust distances computed by, e.g.,
      MCD - covMcd().

      variable is the dependent one.
