      .. rubric:: Cushny and Peebles Prolongation of Sleep Data
         :name: cushny-and-peebles-prolongation-of-sleep-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The original data set was bivariate and recorded for ten subjects
      the prolongation of sleep caused by two different drugs. These
      data were used by Student as the first illustration of the paired
      t-test which only needs the *differences* of the two measurements.
      These differences are the values of ``cushny``.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

         data(cushny, package="robustbase")

      These data were used by Student(1908) as the first illustration of
      the paired t-test, see also ``sleep``; then cited by Fisher (1925)
      and thereforth copied in numerous books as an example of a
      normally distributed sample, see, e.g., Anderson (1958).

         d.sleep <- local({ gr <- with(datasets::sleep, split(extra, group))
                            gr[[2]] - gr[[1]] })

                             sort(d.sleep), tolerance=1e-15))
