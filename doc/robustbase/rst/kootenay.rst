      .. rubric:: Waterflow Measurements of Kootenay River in Libby and
         Newgate
         :name: waterflow-measurements-of-kootenay-river-in-libby-and-newgate

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The original data set is the waterflow in January of the Kootenay
      river, measured at two locations, namely, Libby (Montana) and
      Newgate (British Columbia) for 13 consecutive years, 1931â€“1943.

      The data set is of mostly interest because it has been used as
      example in innumerous didactical situations about robust
      regression. To this end, one number (in observation 4) has been
      modified from the original data from originally 44.9 to 15.7
      (here).

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(kootenay, package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 13 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ``Libby``
         a numeric vector

      ``Newgate``
         a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The original (unmodified) version of the data is easily obtainable
      as ``kootenay0`` from the examples; other modified versions of the
      data sets are also used in different places, see the examples
      below.

         kootenay0[4, "Newgate"] <- 44.9
         plot(kootenay0, main = "'kootenay0': the original data")

         abline(lmrob(Newgate ~ Libby, data = kootenay0), col = "blue")

         ## The version with "milder" outlier -- Hampel et al., p.310
         kootenay2 <- kootenay0
         kootenay2[4, "Libby"] <- 20.0 # instead of 77.6
         plot(kootenay2, main = "The 'kootenay2' data",
              xlim = range(kootenay[,"Libby"]))
