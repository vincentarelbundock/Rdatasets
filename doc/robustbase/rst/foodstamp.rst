         :name: food-stamp-program-participation

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data consists of 150 randomly selected persons from a survey
      with information on over 2000 elderly US citizens, where the
      response, indicates participation in the U.S. Food Stamp Program.

         data(foodstamp, package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 150 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``participation``
         participation in U.S. Food Stamp Program; yes = 1, no = 0

      ``tenancy``
         tenancy, indicating home ownership; yes = 1, no = 0

      ``suppl.income``
         supplemental income, indicating whether some form of
         supplemental security income is received; yes = 1, no = 0

      ``income``
         monthly income (in US dollars)
