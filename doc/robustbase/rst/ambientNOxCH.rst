      This dataset contains daily means (from midnight to midnight) of
      NOx, i.e., mono-nitrogen oxides, in [ppb] at 13 sites in central
      Switzerland and Aarau for the year 2004.

      A data frame with 366 observations on the following 14 variables.

      ``date``
         date of day, of class ``"Date"``.

      ``ad``
         Site is located north of Altdorf 100 meters east of motorway
         A2, on an open field at the beginning of a more than 2000m deep
         valley (690.175, 193.55; 438; inLuft)

      ``ba``
         Site is located in the centre of the little town of Baden in a
         residential area. Baden has 34'000 inhabitants and is situated
         on the swiss plateau (666.075, 257.972; 377; inLuft).

      ``ef``
         Site is located 6 km south of altdorf and 800 m north of the
         village of Erstfeld. The motorway A2 passes 5 m west of the
         measuring site. Over 8 million vehicles have passed Erstfeld in
         2004 where 13% of the counts were attributed to trucks (691.43,
         187.69; 457; MFM-U).

      ``la``
         Site is located on a wooded hill in a rural area called
         Laegern, about 190 m above Baden, which is about 5 km away
         (669.8, 259; 690; NABEL).

      ``lu``
         Site is located in the center of town of Lucerne, which has
         57'000 inhabitants (666.19, 211.975; 460; inLuft).

      ``re``
         Site is located 1 km west of Reiden on the Swiss plateau. The
         motorway A2 passes 5 m west of the measuring site (639.56,
         232.11; 462; MFM-U).

      ``ri``
         Site is located at Rigi Seebodenalp, 649 m above the lake of
         Lucerne on an alp with half a dozen small houses (677.9, 213.5;
         1030; NABEL).

      ``se``
         Site is located in Sedel next to town of Lucerne 35m above and
         250m south of motorway A14 from Zug to Lucerne on a low hill
         with free 360Â° panorama (665.5, 213.41; 484; inLuft).

      ``si``
         Site is located at the border of a small industrial area in
         Sisseln, 300 m east of a main road (640.725, 266.25; 305;
         inLuft).

      ``st``
         Site is located at the south east border of Stans with 7'000
         inhabitants (670.85, 201.025; 438; inLuft).

      ``su``
         Site is located in the center of Suhr (8700 inhabitants), 10 m
         from the main road (648.49, 246.985; 403; inLuft).

      ``sz``
         Site is located in Schwyz (14'200 inhabitants) near a shopping
         center (691.92, 208.03; 470; inLuft).

      ``zg``
         Site is located in the centre of Zug with 22'000 inhabitants,
         24 m from the main road (681.625, 224.625; 420; inLuft).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      | The 13 sites are part of one of the three air quality monitoring
        networks: inLuft (regional authorities of central Switzerland
        and canton Aargau)
      | NABEL (Swiss federal network)
      | MFM-U (Monitoring flankierende Massnahmen Umwelt), special Swiss
        federal network along transit motorways A2 and A13 from Germany
        to Italy through Switzerland
      | The information within the brackets means: Swiss coordinates km
        east, km north; m above sea level; network

      When the measuring sites are exposed to the same atmospheric
      condition and when there is no singular emission event at any
      site, ``log(mean(NOx) of a specific day at each site)`` is a
      linear function of
      ``log(yearly.mean(NOx) at the corresponding site)``. The offset
      and the slope of the straight line reflects the atmospheric
      conditions at this specific day. During winter time, often an
      inversion prevents the emissions from being diluted vertically, so
      that there evolve two separate atmospheric compartements: One
      below the inversion boundary with polluted air and one above with
      relatively clean air. In our example below, Rigi Seebodenalp is
      above the inversion boundary between December 10th and 12th.
