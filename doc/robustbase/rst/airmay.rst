      Air Quality Data Set for May 1973, from Chambers et al. (1983).
      The whole data set consists of daily readings of air quality
      values from May 1, 1973 to September 30, 1973, but here are
      included only the values for May. This data set is an example of
      the special treatment of the missing values.
