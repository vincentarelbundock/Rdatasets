      .. rubric:: NOx Air Pollution Data
         :name: nox-air-pollution-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A typical medium sized environmental data set with hourly
      measurements of ``NOx`` pollution content in the ambient air.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data(NOxEmissions, package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 8088 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``julday``
         day number, a factor with levels ``373`` ... ``730``, typically
         with 24 hourly measurements.

      ``LNOx``
         ``\log`` of hourly mean of NOx concentration in ambient air
         [ppb] next to a highly frequented motorway.

      ``LNOxEm``
         ``\log`` of hourly sum of NOx emission of cars on this motorway
         in arbitrary units.

      ``sqrtWS``
         Square root of wind speed [m/s].

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The original data set had more observations, but with missing
      values. Here, all cases with missing values were omitted
      (``na.omit(.)``), and then only those were retained that belonged
      to days with at least 20 (fully) observed hourly measurements.

          ## p = 340  ==> already Least Squares is not fast
          (lmNOx <- lm(LNOx ~ . ,data = NOxEmissions))
          plot(lmNOx) #->  indication of 1 outlier

          M.NOx <- MASS::rlm(LNOx ~ . , data = NOxEmissions)
          ## M-estimation works
          ## whereas  MM-estimation fails:
          try(MM.NOx <- MASS::rlm(LNOx ~ . , data = NOxEmissions, method = "MM"))
          ## namely because S-estimation fails:
          try(lts.NOx <- ltsReg(LNOx ~ . , data = NOxEmissions))
          try(lmR.NOx <- lmrob (LNOx ~ . , data = NOxEmissions))
