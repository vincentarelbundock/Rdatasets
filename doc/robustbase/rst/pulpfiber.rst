      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Measurements of aspects pulp fibers and the paper produced from
      them. Four properties of each are measured in sixty-two samples.

      A data frame with 62 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``X1``
         numeric vector of arithmetic fiber length

      ``X2``
         numeric vector of long fiber fraction

      ``X3``
         numeric vector of fine fiber fraction

      ``X4``
         numeric vector of zero span tensile

      ``Y1``
         numeric vector of breaking length

      ``Y2``
         numeric vector of elastic modulus

      ``Y3``
         numeric vector of stress at failure

      ``Y4``
         numeric vector of burst strength

      Cited from the reference article: *The dataset contains
      measurements of properties of pulp fibers and the paper made from
      them. The aim is to investigate relations between pulp fiber
      properties and the resulting paper properties. The dataset
      contains ``n = 62`` measurements of the following four pulp fiber
      characteristics: arithmetic fiber length, long fiber fraction,
      fine fiber fraction, and zero span tensile. The four paper
      properties that have been measured are breaking length, elastic
      modulus, stress at failure, and burst strength.*

      The goal is to predict the ``q = 4`` paper properties from the
      ``p = 4`` fiber characteristics.
