      .. rubric:: Insect Damages on Carrots
         :name: insect-damages-on-carrots

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The damage carrots data set from Phelps (1982) was used by
      McCullagh and Nelder (1989) in order to illustrate diagnostic
      techniques because of the presence of an outlier. In a soil
      experiment trial with three blocks, eight levels of insecticide
      were applied and the carrots were tested for insect damage.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data(carrots, package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 24 observations on the following 4 variables.

      success
         integer giving the number of carrots with insect damage.

      total
         integer giving the total number of carrots per experimental
         unit.

      logdose
         a numeric vector giving log(dose) values (eight different
         levels only).

      block
         factor with levels ``B1`` to ``B3``
