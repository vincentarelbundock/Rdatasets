      .. rubric:: Steam Usage Data (Excerpt)
         :name: steam-usage-data-excerpt

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The monthly use of steam (``Steam``) in a factory may be modeled
      and described as function of the operating days per month
      (``Operating.Days``) and mean outside temperature per month
      (``Temperature``).

         data("steamUse", package="robustbase")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 25 observations on the following 9 variables.

      ``Steam``:
         regression response ``Y``, the poinds of steam used monthly.

      ``fattyAcid``:
         pounds of Real Fatty Acid in storage per month.

      ``glycerine``:
         pounds of crude glycerine made.

      ``wind``:
         average wind velocity in miles per hour (a numeric vector).

      ``days``:
         an integer vector with number of days of that month, i.e., in
         ``28..31``.

      ``op.days``:
         the number of operating days for the given month (integer).

      ``freeze.d``:
         the number of days below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (``= 0``\ Â°C
         (C=Celsius) ``=`` freezing temperature of water).

      ``temperature``:
         a numeric vector of average outside temperature in Fahrenheit
         (F).

      ``startups``:
         the number of startups (of production in that month).

      Nor further information is given in Draper and Smith, about the
      place and exacts years of the measurements, though some educated
      guesses should be possible, see the examples.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      Data from Draper and Smith, 1st ed, 1966; appendix A.

      A version of this has been used in teaching at SfS ETH Zurich,
      since at least 1996,
      https://stat.ethz.ch/Teaching/Datasets/NDK/dsteam.dat

      The package
      `aprean3 <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=aprean3>`__ contains
      all data sets from the 3rd edition of Draper and Smith (1998), and
      this data set with variable names ``x1 .. x10`` (``x9`` being
      ``wind^2``, hence extraneous).

         ## starting in a leap year (perhaps 1960 ?).
