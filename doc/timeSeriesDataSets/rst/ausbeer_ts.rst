      The dataset name has been changed to 'ausbeer_ts' to avoid
      confusion with other packages in the R ecosystem from which
      datasets have been sourced. This naming convention helps
      distinguish this dataset as part of the 'timeseriesdatasets'
      package and assists users in identifying its specific
      characteristics. The suffix 'ts' identifies the dataset as a time
      series object, helping to differentiate it from other datasets
      within the package. The original content of the dataset has not
      been modified in any way.
