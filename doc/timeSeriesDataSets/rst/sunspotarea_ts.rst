      The dataset name has been changed to 'sunspotarea_ts' to avoid
      confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem from which data
      have been sourced. The suffix 'ts' indicates that this dataset is
      a time series object. This naming convention helps distinguish
      this dataset as part of the 'timeseriesdatasets' package and
      assists users in identifying its specific characteristics. The
      original content of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
