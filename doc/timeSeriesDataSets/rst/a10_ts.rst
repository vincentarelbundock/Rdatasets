      The dataset name has been changed to 'a10_ts' to avoid confusion
      with other packages in the R ecosystem from which datasets have
      been sourced. This naming convention helps distinguish this
      dataset as part of the 'timeseriesdatasets' package and assists
      users in identifying its specific characteristics. The suffix 'ts'
      identifies the dataset as a time series, helping to differentiate
      it from other datasets within the package. The original content of
      the dataset has not been modified in any way.
