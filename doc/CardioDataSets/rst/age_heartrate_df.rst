      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset, age_heartrate_df, is a data frame containing
      simulated data representing the relationship between age and
      maximum heart rate. It includes 15 observations based on
      established physiological models.

      The dataset name has been kept as 'age_heartrate_df' to avoid
      confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem. This naming
      convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
