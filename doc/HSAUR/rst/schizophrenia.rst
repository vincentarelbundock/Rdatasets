      A sex difference in the age of onset of schizophrenia was noted by
      Kraepelin (1919). Subsequently epidemiological studies of the
      disorder have consistently shown an earlier onset in men than in
      women. One model that has been suggested to explain this observed
      difference is know as the subtype model which postulates two type
      of schizophrenia, one characterised by early onset, typical
      symptoms and poor premorbid competence, and the other by late
      onset, atypical symptoms, and good premorbid competence. The early
      onset type is assumed to be largely a disorder of men and the late
      onset largely a disorder of women.
