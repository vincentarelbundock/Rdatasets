      A data frame with 18 observations on the following 2 variables.

      method1
         Root mean square bending moment in Newton metres, mooring
         method 1

      method2
         Root mean square bending moment in Newton metres, mooring
         method 2

      In a design study for a device to generate electricity from wave
      power at sea, experiments were carried out on scale models in a
      wave tank to establish how the choice of mooring method for the
      system affected the bending stress produced in part of the device.
      The wave tank could simulate a wide range of sea states and the
      model system was subjected to the same sample of sea states with
      each of two mooring methods, one of which was considerably cheaper
      than the other. The question of interest is whether bending stress
      differs for the two mooring methods.
