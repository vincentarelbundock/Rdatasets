      A data frame with 22 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``GHQ``
         the General Health Questionnaire score.

      ``sex``
         a factor with levels ``female`` and ``male``

      ``cases``
         the number of diseased subjects.

      ``non.cases``
         the number of healthy subjects.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data arise from a study of a psychiatric screening
      questionnaire called the GHQ (General Health Questionnaire, see
      Goldberg, 1972). Here the main question of interest is to see how
      caseness is related to gender and GHQ score.
