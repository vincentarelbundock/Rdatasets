      .. rubric:: Gain in Weight of Rats
         :name: gain-in-weight-of-rats

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data arise from an experiment to study the gain in weight of
      rats fed on four different diets, distinguished by amount of
      protein (low and high) and by source of protein (beef and cereal).

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("weightgain")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 40 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``source``
         source of protein given, a factor with levels ``Beef`` and
         ``Cereal``.

      ``type``
         amount of protein given, a factor with levels ``High`` and
         ``Low``.

      ``weightgain``
         weigt gain in grams.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Ten rats are randomized to each of the four treatments. The
      question of interest is how diet affects weight gain.
