      .. rubric:: Cloud Seeding Data
         :name: cloud-seeding-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from an experiment investigating the use of massive amounts
      of silver iodide (100 to 1000 grams per cloud) in cloud seeding to
      increase rainfall.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data("clouds")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 24 observations on the following 7 variables.

      seeding
         a factor indicating whether seeding action occured (``no`` or
         ``yes``).

      time
         number of days after the first day of the experiment.

      sne
         suitability criterion.

      cloudcover
         the percentage cloud cover in the experimental area, measured
         using radar.

      prewetness
         the total rainfall in the target area one hour before seeding
         (in cubic metres times ``1e+8``).

      echomotion
         a factor showing whether the radar echo was ``moving`` or
         ``stationary``.

      rainfall
         the amount of rain in cubic metres times ``1e+8``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Weather modification, or cloud seeding, is the treatment of
      individual clouds or storm systems with various inorganic and
      organic materials in the hope of achieving an increase in
      rainfall. Introduction of such material into a cloud that contains
      supercooled water, that is, liquid water colder than zero Celsius,
      has the aim of inducing freezing, with the consequent ice
      particles growing at the expense of liquid droplets and becoming
      heavy enough to fall as rain from clouds that otherwise would
      produce none.

      The data available in ``cloud`` were collected in the summer of
      1975 from an experiment to investigate the use of massive amounts
      of silver iodide 100 to 1000 grams per cloud) in cloud seeding to
      increase rainfall. In the experiment, which was conducted in an
      area of Florida, 24 days were judged suitable for seeding on the
      basis that a measured suitability criterion (``SNE``).
