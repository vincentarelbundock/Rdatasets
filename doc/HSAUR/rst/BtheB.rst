         :name: details

      Longitudinal data from a clinical trial of an interactive,
      multimedia program known as "Beat the Blues" designed to deliver
      cognitive behavioural therapy to depressed patients via a computer
      terminal. Patients with depression recruited in primary care were
      randomised to either the Beating the Blues program, or to
      "Treatment as Usual (TAU)".

      Note that the data are stored in the wide form, i.e., repeated
      measurments are represented by additional columns in the data
      frame.
