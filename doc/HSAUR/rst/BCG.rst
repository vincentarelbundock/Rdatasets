      A data frame with 13 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``Study``
         an identifier of the study.

      ``BCGTB``
         the number of subjects suffering from TB after a BCG
         vaccination.

      ``BCGVacc``
         the number of subjects with BCG vaccination.

      ``NoVaccTB``
         the number of subjects suffering from TB without BCG
         vaccination.

      ``NoVacc``
         the total number of subjects without BCG vaccination.

      ``Latitude``
         geographic position of the place the study was undertaken.

      ``Year``
         the year the study was undertaken.

      Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccination
      in the world. Developed in the 1930s and made of a live, weakened
      strain of Mycobacterium bovis, the BCG is the only vaccination
      available against tuberculosis today. Colditz et al. (1994) report
      data from 13 clinical trials of BCG vaccine each investigating its
      efficacy in the treatment of tuberculosis. The number of subjects
      suffering from TB with or without BCG vaccination are given here.
      In addition, the data contains the values of two other variables
      for each study, namely, the geographic latitude of the place where
      the study was undertaken and the year of publication. These two
      variables will be used to investigate and perhaps explain any
      heterogeneity among the studies.
