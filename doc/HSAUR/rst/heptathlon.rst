      The first combined Olympic event for women was the pentathlon,
      first held in Germany in 1928. Initially this consisted of the
      shot putt, long jump, 100m, high jump and javelin events held over
      two days. The pentathlon was first introduced into the Olympic
      Games in 1964, when it consisted of the 80m hurdles, shot, high
      jump, long jump and 200m. In 1977 the 200m was replaced by the
      800m and from 1981 the IAAF brought in the seven-event heptathlon
      in place of the pentathlon, with day one containing the
      events-100m hurdles, shot, high jump, 200m and day two, the long
      jump, javelin and 800m. A scoring system is used to assign points
      to the results from each event and the winner is the woman who
      accumulates the most points over the two days. The event made its
      first Olympic appearance in 1984.

      In the 1988 Olympics held in Seoul, the heptathlon was won by one
      of the stars of women's athletics in the USA, Jackie
      Joyner-Kersee. The results for all 25 competitors are given here.
