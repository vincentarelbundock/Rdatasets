         :name: foster-feeding-experiment

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data are from a foster feeding experiment with rat mothers and
      litters of four different genotypes. The measurement is the litter
      weight after a trial feeding period.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data("foster")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 61 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``litgen``
         genotype of the litter, a factor with levels ``A``, ``B``,
         ``I``, and ``J``.

      ``motgen``
         genotype of the mother, a factor with levels ``A``, ``B``,
         ``I``, and ``J``.

      ``weight``
         the weight of the litter after a feeding period.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Here the interest lies in uncovering the effect of genotype of
      mother and litter on litter weight.
