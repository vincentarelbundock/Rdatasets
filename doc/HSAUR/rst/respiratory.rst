         :name: respiratory-illness-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The respiratory status of patients recruited for a randomised
      clinical multicenter trial.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data("respiratory")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 555 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``centre``
         the study center, a factor with levels ``1`` and ``2``.

      ``treatment``
         the treatment arm, a factor with levels ``placebo`` and
         ``treatment``.

      ``sex``
         a factor with levels ``female`` and ``male``.

      ``age``
         the age of the patient.

      ``status``
         the respiratory status (response variable), a factor with
         levels ``poor`` and ``good``.

      ``month``
         the month, each patient was examined at months ``0``, ``1``,
         ``2``, ``3`` and ``4``.

      ``subject``
         the patient ID, a factor with levels ``1`` to ``111``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      In each of two centres, eligible patients were randomly assigned
      to active treatment or placebo. During the treatment, the
      respiratory status (categorised ``poor`` or ``good``) was
      determined at each of four, monthly visits. The trial recruited
      111 participants (54 in the active group, 57 in the placebo group)
      and there were no missing data for either the responses or the
      covariates. The question of interest is to assess whether the
      treatment is effective and to estimate its effect.

      Note that the data are in long form, i.e, repeated measurments are
      stored as additional rows in the data frame.
