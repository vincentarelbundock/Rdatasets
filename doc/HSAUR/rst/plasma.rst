      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and measurements of two plasma
      proteins (fibrinogen and globulin).

         :name: usage

      ::

         data("plasma")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 32 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``fibrinogen``
         the fibrinogen level in the blood.

      ``globulin``
         the globulin level in the blood.

      ``ESR``
         the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, either less or greater 20
         mm / hour.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which red
      blood cells (erythrocytes) settle out of suspension in blood
      plasma, when measured under standard conditions. If the ESR
      increases when the level of certain proteins in the blood plasma
      rise in association with conditions such as rheumatic diseases,
      chronic infections and malignant diseases, its determination might
      be useful in screening blood samples taken form people suspected
      to being suffering from one of the conditions mentioned. The
      absolute value of the ESR is not of great importance rather it is
      whether it is less than 20mm/hr since lower values indicate a
      healthy individual.

      The question of interest is whether there is any association
      between the probability of an ESR reading greater than 20mm/hr and
      the levels of the two plasma proteins. If there is not then the
      determination of ESR would not be useful for diagnostic purposes.
