      A data frame with 25 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``age``
         the age of the subject.

      ``fat``
         the body fat percentage.

      ``sex``
         a factor with levels ``female`` and ``male``.

         :name: details

      The data come from a study investigating a new methods of
      measuring body composition (see Mazess et al, 1984), and give the
      body fat percentage (percent fat), age and sex for 25 normal
      adults aged between 23 and 61 years. The questions of interest are
      how are age and percent fat related, and is there any evidence
      that the relationship is different for males and females.
