      Corbet et al. (1970) report a study of water voles (genus
      Arvicola) in which the aim was to compare British populations of
      these animals with those in Europe, to investigate whether more
      than one species might be present in Britain. The original data
      consisted of observations of the presence or absence of 13
      characteristics in about 300 water vole skulls arising from six
      British populations and eight populations from the rest of Europe.
      The data are the percentage incidence of the 13 characteristics in
      each of the 14 samples of water vole skulls.
