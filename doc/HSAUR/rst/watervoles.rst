   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Corbet et al. (1970) report a study of water voles (genus Arvicola)
   in which the aim was to compare British populations of these animals
   with those in Europe, to investigate whether more than one species
   might be present in Britain. The original data consisted of
   observations of the presence or absence of 13 characteristics in
   about 300 water vole skulls arising from six British populations and
   eight populations from the rest of Europe. The data are the
   percentage incidence of the 13 characteristics in each of the 14
   samples of water vole skulls.
