      .. rubric:: Piston Rings Failures
         :name: piston-rings-failures

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Number of failures of piston rings in three legs of four
      steam-driven compressors.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("pistonrings")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A two-way classification, see ``table``.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data are given in form of a ``table``. The table gives the
      number of piston-ring failures in each of three legs of four
      steam-driven compressors located in the same building. The
      compressors have identical design and are oriented in the same
      way. The question of interest is whether the two classification
      variables (compressor and leg) are independent.
