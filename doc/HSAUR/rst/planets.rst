      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 101 observations from 101 exoplanets on the
      following 3 variables.

      mass
         Jupiter mass of the planet.

      period
         period in earth days.

      eccen
         the radial eccentricity of the planet.

         :name: details

      From the properties of the exoplanets found up to now it appears
      that the theory of planetary development constructed for the
      planets of the Solar System may need to be reformulated. The
      exoplanets are not at all like the nine local planets that we know
      so well. A first step in the process of understanding the
      exoplanets might be to try to classify them with respect to their
      known properties.
