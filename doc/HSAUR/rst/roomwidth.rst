         :name: students-estimates-of-lecture-room-width

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Lecture room width estimated by students in two different units.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      ::

         data("roomwidth")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 113 observations on the following 2 variables.

      unit
         a factor with levels ``feet`` and ``metres``.

      width
         the estimated width of the lecture room.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Shortly after metric units of length were officially introduced in
      Australia, each of a group of 44 students was asked to guess, to
      the nearest metre, the width of the lecture hall in which they
      were sitting. Another group of 69 students in the same room was
      asked to guess the width in feet, to the nearest foot. The data
      were collected by Professor T. Lewis and are taken from Hand et al
      (1994). The main question is whether estimation in feet and in
      metres gives different results.
