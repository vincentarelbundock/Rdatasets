<h2> Rearrests of Juvenile Felons </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Rearrests of juventile felons by type of court in which they were tried.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("rearrests")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A two-way classification, see <code>table</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data (taken from Agresti, 1996) arise from a 
sample of juveniles convicted of felony in Florida in 1987. Matched
pairs were formed using criteria such as age and the number of
previous offences. For each pair, one subject was handled in
the juvenile court and the other was transferred to the adult
court. Whether or not the juvenile was rearrested by the end 
of 1988 was then noted. Here the question of interest is whether
the true proportions rearrested were identical for the adult 
and juvenile court assignments?
