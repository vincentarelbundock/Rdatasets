      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A dataset with artificial daily lab data for a patient with Yellow
      Fever (YF). The table comprises laboratory findings for the
      patient from day 3 of illness onset until day 9 (after which the
      patient died). YF viral DNA was found in serum samples from day 3,
      where the viral load reached 14,000 copies per mL. Several medical
      interventions were taken to help the patient, including the
      administration of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, red cells, and
      coagulation factor VIII. The patient also received advanced
      support treatment in the form of mechanical ventilation and
      plasmapheresis. Though the patient's temperature remained stable
      during their illness, unfortunately, the patient's condition did
      not improve. On days 7 and 8, the patient's health declined
      further, with symptoms such as nosebleeds, gastrointestinal
      bleeding, and hematoma.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A tibble with 39 rows and 11 variables:

      test
         The name of the test.

      units
         The measurement units for the test.

      day_3,day_4,day_5,day_6,day_7,day_8,day_9
         Measurement values associated with each test administered from
         days 3 to 9. An ``NA`` value indicates that the test could not
         be performed that day.

      norm_l,norm_u
         Lower and upper bounds for the normal range associated with the
         test.
