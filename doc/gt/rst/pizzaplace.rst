         :name: a-year-of-pizza-sales-from-a-pizza-place

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A synthetic dataset that describes pizza sales for a pizza place
      somewhere in the US. While the contents are artificial, the
      ingredients used to make the pizzas are far from it. There are 32
      different pizzas that fall into 4 different categories:
      ``"classic"`` (classic pizzas: 'You probably had one like it
      before, but never like this!'), ``"chicken"`` (pizzas with chicken
      as a major ingredient: 'Try the Southwest Chicken Pizza! You'll
      love it!'), ``"supreme"`` (pizzas that try a little harder: 'My
      Soppressata pizza uses only the finest salami from my personal
      salumist!'), and, ``"veggie"`` (pizzas without any meats
      whatsoever: 'My Five Cheese pizza has so many cheeses, I can only
      offer it in Large Size!').
