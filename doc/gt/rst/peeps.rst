      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``peeps`` dataset contains records for one hundred people
      residing in ten different countries. Each person in the table has
      address information along with their email address and phone
      number. There are also personal characteristics like date of
      birth, height, and weight. This data has been synthesized, and so
      the names within the table have not been taken or based on
      individuals in real life. The street addresses were generated from
      actual street names within real geographic localities, however,
      the street numbers were assigned randomly from a constrained
      number set. While these records do not relate to real people,
      efforts were made to make the data as realistic as possible.
