      Cognitive scores of infants in a study of early childhood
      intervention. The 103 infants from low income African American
      families were divided into a treatment group (58 infants) and a
      control group (45 infants). Starting at 0.5 years of age the
      infants in the treatment group were exposed to an enriched
      environment. Each infant's cognitive score on an age-specific,
      normalized scale was recorded at ages 1, 1.5, and 2 years.
