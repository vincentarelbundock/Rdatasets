         :name: details

      The concentrations for 11 major and minor elements in 105
      Romano-British waste glass specimens from two furnace sites
      (Leicester and Mancetter) come from Caroline Jackson's Ph. D.
      thesis at Bradford University. The data here were scanned from
      from Baxter (1994) Table A1. Measurements are percentage for each
      element.
