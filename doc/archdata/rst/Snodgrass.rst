      The data from 91 house pits at the Snodgrass site were reported by
      Price and Giffin in 1979. The layout of the houses follows a grid
      pattern with the long axis oriented northeast surrounded by a
      fortification trench. There is also evidence of an interior wall
      that may have separated the houses inside that wall from those
      outside the wall. Price and Griffin use differences in house size
      and artifact composition to suggest that those differences may
      have reflected rank differences between the occupants of the two
      areas. That conclusion has been questioned on a number of grounds
      by Cogswell, et al (2001), but the data are still useful for
      illustrating a number of quantitative methods. The data come from
      the appendices except for the house locations which were estimated
      from the base map in Figure 10 (Price and Griffin 1979).
