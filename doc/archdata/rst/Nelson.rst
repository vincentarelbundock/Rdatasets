      ``Type_II_Red``
         Number of two color glazed red ware ceramics

      ``Type_II_Yellow``
         Number of two color glazed yellow ware ceramics

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data from a midden deposit at San Cristobal in the American
      Southwest. It has been used as a classic illustration of the
      potential for creating a relative chronology using frequency
      seriation of ceramic artifact types. The site was occupied
      approximately from CE 1350 to 1680. Ceramic artifact fragment
      counts are presented for each 1-foot (30 cm) arbitrary level
      excavated in the midden deposit. When converted to percentages
      (usually excluding the corrugated ware), the data illustrate a
      classical "battleship curve" like those described in Ford (1962).
