         :name: details

      Measurements on five types of dart points from Fort Hood in
      central Texas (Darl, Ensor, Pedernales, Travis, and Wells). The
      points were recovered during 10 different pedestrian survey
      projects during the 1980's and were classified and measured by H.
      Blaine Ensor using the system created by Futato (1983) as
      described in Carlson, S., et al 1987, pp 51-70 and Appendices 4
      and 7.
