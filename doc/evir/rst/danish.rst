      These data describe large fire insurance claims in Denmark from
      Thursday 3rd January 1980 until Monday 31st December 1990. The
      data are contained in a numeric vector. The dates of each

      supplied by Mette Rytgaard of Copenhagen Re. Note that these data
      form an irregular time series.
