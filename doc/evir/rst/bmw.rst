      These data are the daily log returns on BMW share price from
      Tuesday 2nd January 1973 until Tuesday 23rd July 1996. The data
      are contained in a numeric vector. The dates of each observation
      are contained in a ``times`` attribute, which is an object of
      class ``"POSIXct"`` (see ``DateTimeClasses``). Note that these
      data form an irregular time series because no trading takes place
      at the weekend.
