      :name: counts-of-ovarian-follicles

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``Ovary`` data frame has 308 rows and 3 columns.

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   This data frame contains the following columns:

   Mare
      an ordered factor indicating the mare on which the measurement is
      made.

   Time
      time in the estrus cycle. The data were recorded daily from 3 days
      before ovulation until 3 days after the next ovulation. The
      measurement times for each mare are scaled so that the ovulations
      for each mare occur at times 0 and 1.

   follicles
      the number of ovarian follicles greater than 10 mm in diameter.
