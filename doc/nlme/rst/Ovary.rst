      .. rubric:: Counts of Ovarian Follicles
         :name: counts-of-ovarian-follicles

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Ovary`` data frame has 308 rows and 3 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Mare
         an ordered factor indicating the mare on which the measurement
         is made.

      Time
         time in the estrus cycle. The data were recorded daily from 3
         days before ovulation until 3 days after the next ovulation.
         The measurement times for each mare are scaled so that the
         ovulations for each mare occur at times 0 and 1.

      follicles
         the number of ovarian follicles greater than 10 mm in diameter.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Pierson and Ginther (1987) report on a study of the number of
      large ovarian follicles detected in different mares at several
      times in their estrus cycles.
