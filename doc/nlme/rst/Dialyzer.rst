      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Dialyzer`` data frame has 140 rows and 5 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Subject
         an ordered factor with levels ``10`` < ``8`` < ``2`` < ``6`` <
         ``3`` < ``5`` < ``9`` < ``7`` < ``1`` < ``4`` < ``17`` < ``20``
         < ``11`` < ``12`` < ``16`` < ``13`` < ``14`` < ``18`` < ``15``
         < ``19`` giving the unique identifier for each subject

      QB
         a factor with levels ``200`` and ``300`` giving the bovine
         blood flow rate (dL/min).

      pressure
         a numeric vector giving the transmembrane pressure (dmHg).

      rate
         the hemodialyzer ultrafiltration rate (mL/hr).

      index
         index of observation within subjectâ€”1 through 7.

      Vonesh and Carter (1992) describe data measured on high-flux
      hemodialyzers to assess their *in vivo* ultrafiltration
      characteristics. The ultrafiltration rates (in mL/hr) of 20
      high-flux dialyzers were measured at seven different transmembrane
      pressures (in dmHg). The *in vitro* evaluation of the dialyzers
      used bovine blood at flow rates of either 200~dl/min or
      300~dl/min. The data, are also analyzed in Littell, Milliken,
      Stroup, and Wolfinger (1996).
