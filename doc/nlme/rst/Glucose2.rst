      Hand and Crowder (Table A.14, pp. 180-181, 1996) describe data on
      the blood glucose levels measured at 14 time points over 5 hours
      for 7 volunteers who took alcohol at time 0. The same experiment
      was repeated on a second date with the same subjects but with a
      dietary additive used for all subjects.
