   Hand and Crowder (Table A.14, pp. 180-181, 1996) describe data on the
   blood glucose levels measured at 14 time points over 5 hours for 7
   volunteers who took alcohol at time 0. The same experiment was
   repeated on a second date with the same subjects but with a dietary
   additive used for all subjects.
