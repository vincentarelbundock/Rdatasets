      The ``Phenobarb`` data frame has 744 rows and 7 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Subject
         an ordered factor identifying the infant.

      Wt
         a numeric vector giving the birth weight of the infant (kg).

      Apgar
         an ordered factor giving the 5-minute Apgar score for the
         infant. This is an indication of health of the newborn infant.

      ApgarInd
         a factor indicating whether the 5-minute Apgar score is ``< 5``
         or ``>= 5``.

      time
         a numeric vector giving the time when the sample is drawn or
         drug administered (hr).

      dose
         a numeric vector giving the dose of drug administered
         (``u``\ g/kg).

      conc
         a numeric vector giving the phenobarbital concentration in the
         serum (``u``\ g/L).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data from a pharmacokinetics study of phenobarbital in neonatal
      infants. During the first few days of life the infants receive
      multiple doses of phenobarbital for prevention of seizures. At
      irregular intervals blood samples are drawn and serum
      phenobarbital concentrations are determined. The data were
      originally given in Grasela and Donn(1985) and are analyzed in
      Boeckmann, Sheiner and Beal (1994), in Davidian and Giltinan
      (1995), and in Littell et al. (1996).
