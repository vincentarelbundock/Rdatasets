      The ``Quinidine`` data frame has 1471 rows and 14 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Subject
         a factor identifying the patient on whom the data were
         collected.

      time
         a numeric vector giving the time (hr) at which the drug was
         administered or the blood sample drawn. This is measured from
         the time the patient entered the study.

      conc
         a numeric vector giving the serum quinidine concentration
         (mg/L).

      dose
         a numeric vector giving the dose of drug administered (mg).
         Although there were two different forms of quinidine
         administered, the doses were adjusted for differences in salt
         content by conversion to milligrams of quinidine base.

      interval
         a numeric vector giving the when the drug has been given at
         regular intervals for a sufficiently long period of time to
         assume steady state behavior, the interval is recorded.

      Age
         a numeric vector giving the age of the subject on entry to the
         study (yr).

      Height
         a numeric vector giving the height of the subject on entry to
         the study (in.).

      Weight
         a numeric vector giving the body weight of the subject (kg).

      Race
         a factor with levels ``Caucasian``, ``Latin``, and ``Black``
         identifying the race of the subject.

      Smoke
         a factor with levels ``no`` and ``yes`` giving smoking status
         at the time of the measurement.

      Ethanol
         a factor with levels ``none``, ``current``, ``former`` giving
         ethanol (alcohol) abuse status at the time of the measurement.

      Heart
         a factor with levels ``No/Mild``, ``Moderate``, and ``Severe``
         indicating congestive heart failure for the subject.

      Creatinine
         an ordered factor with levels ``< 50`` < ``>= 50`` indicating
         the creatinine clearance (mg/min).

      glyco
         a numeric vector giving the alpha-1 acid glycoprotein
         concentration (mg/dL). Often measured at the same time as the
         quinidine concentration.

      Verme et al. (1992) analyze routine clinical data on patients
      receiving the drug quinidine as a treatment for cardiac arrhythmia
      (atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias). All patients
      were receiving oral quinidine doses. At irregular intervals blood
      samples were drawn and serum concentrations of quinidine were
      determined. These data are analyzed in several publications,
      including Davidian and Giltinan (1995, section 9.3).
