      .. rubric:: Heights of Boys in Oxford
         :name: heights-of-boys-in-oxford

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Oxboys`` data frame has 234 rows and 4 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Subject
         an ordered factor giving a unique identifier for each boy in
         the experiment

      age
         a numeric vector giving the standardized age (dimensionless)

      height
         a numeric vector giving the height of the boy (cm)

      Occasion
         an ordered factor - the result of converting ``age`` from a
         continuous variable to a count so these slightly unbalanced
         data can be analyzed as balanced.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      These data are described in Goldstein (1987) as data on the height
      of a selection of boys from Oxford, England versus a standardized
      age.
