         :name: effect-of-phenylbiguanide-on-blood-pressure

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``PBG`` data frame has 60 rows and 5 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      deltaBP
         a numeric vector

      dose
         a numeric vector

      Run
         an ordered factor with levels ``T5`` < ``T4`` < ``T3`` < ``T2``
         < ``T1`` < ``P5`` < ``P3`` < ``P2`` < ``P4`` < ``P1``

      Treatment
         a factor with levels ``MDL 72222`` ``Placebo``

      Rabbit
         an ordered factor with levels ``5`` < ``3`` < ``2`` < ``4`` <
         ``1``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data on an experiment to examine the effect of a antagonist MDL
      72222 on the change in blood pressure experienced with increasing
      dosage of phenylbiguanide are described in Ludbrook (1994) and
      analyzed in Venables and Ripley (2002, section 10.3). Each of five
      rabbits was exposed to increasing doses of phenylbiguanide after
      having either a placebo or the HD5-antagonist MDL 72222
      administered.
