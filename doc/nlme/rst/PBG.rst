      :name: PBG

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``PBG`` data frame has 60 rows and 5 columns.

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   This data frame contains the following columns:

   deltaBP
      a numeric vector

   dose
      a numeric vector

   Run
      an ordered factor with levels ``T5`` < ``T4`` < ``T3`` < ``T2`` <
      ``T1`` < ``P5`` < ``P3`` < ``P2`` < ``P4`` < ``P1``

   Treatment
      a factor with levels ``MDL 72222`` ``Placebo``

   Rabbit
      an ordered factor with levels ``5`` < ``3`` < ``2`` < ``4`` <
      ``1``

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Data on an experiment to examine the effect of a antagonist MDL 72222
   on the change in blood pressure experienced with increasing dosage of
   phenylbiguanide are described in Ludbrook (1994) and analyzed in
   Venables and Ripley (2002, section 10.3). Each of five rabbits was
   exposed to increasing doses of phenylbiguanide after having either a
   placebo or the HD5-antagonist MDL 72222 administered.
