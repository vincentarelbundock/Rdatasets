   These data have been introduced by Yates (1935) as an example of a
   split-plot design. The treatment structure used in the experiment was
   a ``3 \times 4`` full factorial, with three varieties of oats and
   four concentrations of nitrogen. The experimental units were arranged
   into six blocks, each with three whole-plots subdivided into four
   subplots. The varieties of oats were assigned randomly to the
   whole-plots and the concentrations of nitrogen to the subplots. All
   four concentrations of nitrogen were used on each whole-plot.
