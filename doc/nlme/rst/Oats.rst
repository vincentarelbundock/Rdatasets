      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Block
         an ordered factor with levels ``VI`` < ``V`` < ``III`` < ``IV``
         < ``II`` < ``I``

      Variety
         a factor with levels ``Golden Rain`` ``Marvellous`` ``Victory``

      nitro
         a numeric vector

      yield

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      These data have been introduced by Yates (1935) as an example of a
      split-plot design. The treatment structure used in the experiment
      was a ``3 \times 4`` full factorial, with three varieties of oats
      and four concentrations of nitrogen. The experimental units were
      arranged into six blocks, each with three whole-plots subdivided
      into four subplots. The varieties of oats were assigned randomly
      to the whole-plots and the concentrations of nitrogen to the
      subplots. All four concentrations of nitrogen were used on each
      whole-plot.
