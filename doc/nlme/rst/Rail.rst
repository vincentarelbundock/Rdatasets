      .. rubric:: Evaluation of Stress in Railway Rails
         :name: evaluation-of-stress-in-railway-rails

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Rail`` data frame has 18 rows and 2 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Rail
         an ordered factor identifying the rail on which the measurement
         was made.

      travel
         a numeric vector giving the travel time for ultrasonic
         head-waves in the rail (nanoseconds). The value given is the
         original travel time minus 36,100 nanoseconds.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Devore (2000, Example 10.10, p. 427) cites data from an article in
      *Materials Evaluation* on “a study of travel time for a certain
      type of wave that results from longitudinal stress of rails used
      for railroad track.”
