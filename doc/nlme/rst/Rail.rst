   .. rubric:: Evaluation of Stress in Railway Rails
      :name: Rail

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``Rail`` data frame has 18 rows and 2 columns.

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   This data frame contains the following columns:

   Rail
      an ordered factor identifying the rail on which the measurement
      was made.

   travel
      a numeric vector giving the travel time for ultrasonic head-waves
      in the rail (nanoseconds). The value given is the original travel
      time minus 36,100 nanoseconds.

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Devore (2000, Example 10.10, p. 427) cites data from an article in
   *Materials Evaluation* on “a study of travel time for a certain type
   of wave that results from longitudinal stress of rails used for
   railroad track.”
