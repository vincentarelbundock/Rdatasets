      .. rubric:: Growth curve data on an orthdontic measurement
         :name: growth-curve-data-on-an-orthdontic-measurement

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Orthodont`` data frame has 108 rows and 4 columns of the
      change in an orthdontic measurement over time for several young
      subjects.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      distance
         a numeric vector of distances from the pituitary to the
         pterygomaxillary fissure (mm). These distances are measured on
         x-ray images of the skull.

      age
         a numeric vector of ages of the subject (yr).

      Subject
         an ordered factor indicating the subject on which the
         measurement was made. The levels are labelled ``M01`` to
         ``M16`` for the males and ``F01`` to ``F13`` for the females.
         The ordering is by increasing average distance within sex.

      Sex
         a factor with levels ``Male`` and ``Female``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Investigators at the University of North Carolina Dental School
      followed the growth of 27 children (16 males, 11 females) from age
      8 until age 14. Every two years they measured the distance between
      the pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure, two points that
      are easily identified on x-ray exposures of the side of the head.
