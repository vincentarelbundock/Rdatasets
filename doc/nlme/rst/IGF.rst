      :name: format

   This data frame contains the following columns:

   Lot
      an ordered factor giving the radioactive tracer lot.

   age
      a numeric vector giving the age (in days) of the radioactive
      tracer.

   conc
      a numeric vector giving the estimated concentration of IGF-I
      protein (ng/ml)

   Davidian and Giltinan (1995) describe data obtained during quality
   control radioimmunoassays for ten different lots of radioactive
   tracer used to calibrate the Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-I)
   protein concentration measurements.
