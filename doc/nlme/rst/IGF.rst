         :name: radioimmunoassay-of-igf-i-protein

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``IGF`` data frame has 237 rows and 3 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Lot
         an ordered factor giving the radioactive tracer lot.

      age
         a numeric vector giving the age (in days) of the radioactive
         tracer.

      conc
         a numeric vector giving the estimated concentration of IGF-I
         protein (ng/ml)

      Davidian and Giltinan (1995) describe data obtained during quality
      control radioimmunoassays for ten different lots of radioactive
      tracer used to calibrate the Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-I)
      protein concentration measurements.
