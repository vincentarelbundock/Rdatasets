      .. rubric:: Bioassay on Cell Culture Plate
         :name: bioassay-on-cell-culture-plate

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Assay`` data frame has 60 rows and 4 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Block
         an ordered factor with levels ``2`` < ``1`` identifying the
         block where the wells are measured.

      sample
         a factor with levels ``a`` to ``f`` identifying the sample
         corresponding to the well.

      dilut
         a factor with levels ``1`` to ``5`` indicating the dilution
         applied to the well

      logDens
         a numeric vector of the log-optical density

      These data, courtesy of Rich Wolfe and David Lansky from Searle,
      Inc., come from a bioassay run on a 96-well cell culture plate.
      The assay is performed using a split-block design. The 8 rows on
      the plate are labeled A–H from top to bottom and the 12 columns on
      the plate are labeled 1–12 from left to right. Only the central 60
      wells of the plate are used for the bioassay (the intersection of
      rows B–G and columns 2–11). There are two blocks in the design:
      Block 1 contains columns 2–6 and Block 2 contains columns 7–11.
      Within each block, six samples are assigned randomly to rows and
      five (serial) dilutions are assigned randomly to columns. The
      response variable is the logarithm of the optical density. The
      cells are treated with a compound that they metabolize to produce
      the stain. Only live cells can make the stain, so the optical
      density is a measure of the number of cells that are alive and
      healthy.
