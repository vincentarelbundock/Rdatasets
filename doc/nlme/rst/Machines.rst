      :name: details

   Data on an experiment to compare three brands of machines used in an
   industrial process are presented in Milliken and Johnson (p. 285,
   1992). Six workers were chosen randomly among the employees of a
   factory to operate each machine three times. The response is an
   overall productivity score taking into account the number and quality
   of components produced.
