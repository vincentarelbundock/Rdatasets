      Data on an experiment to compare three brands of machines used in
      an industrial process are presented in Milliken and Johnson (p.
      285, 1992). Six workers were chosen randomly among the employees
      of a factory to operate each machine three times. The response is
      an overall productivity score taking into account the number and
      quality of components produced.
