      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Variety
         a factor with levels ``Cossack``, ``Ladak``, and ``Ranger``

      Date
         a factor with levels ``None`` ``S1`` ``S20`` ``O7``

      Block
         a factor with levels ``1`` ``2`` ``3`` ``4`` ``5`` ``6``

      Yield

      These data are described in Snedecor and Cochran (1980) as an
      example of a split-plot design. The treatment structure used in
      the experiment was a 3\ ``x``\ 4 full factorial, with three
      varieties of alfalfa and four dates of third cutting in 1943. The
      experimental units were arranged into six blocks, each subdivided
      into four plots. The varieties of alfalfa (*Cossac*, *Ladak*, and
      *Ranger*) were assigned randomly to the blocks and the dates of
      third cutting (*None*, *S1*—September 1, *S20*—September 20, and
      *O7*—October 7) were randomly assigned to the plots. All four
      dates were used on each block.
