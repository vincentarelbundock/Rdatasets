   Date
      a factor with levels ``None`` ``S1`` ``S20`` ``O7``

   Block
      a factor with levels ``1`` ``2`` ``3`` ``4`` ``5`` ``6``

   Yield
      a numeric vector

   These data are described in Snedecor and Cochran (1980) as an example
   of a split-plot design. The treatment structure used in the
   experiment was a 3\ ``x``\ 4 full factorial, with three varieties of
   alfalfa and four dates of third cutting in 1943. The experimental
   units were arranged into six blocks, each subdivided into four plots.
   The varieties of alfalfa (*Cossac*, *Ladak*, and *Ranger*) were
   assigned randomly to the blocks and the dates of third cutting
   (*None*, *S1*—September 1, *S20*—September 20, and *O7*—October 7)
   were randomly assigned to the plots. All four dates were used on each
   block.
