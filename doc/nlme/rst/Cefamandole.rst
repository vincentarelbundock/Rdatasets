      Davidian and Giltinan (1995, 1.1, p. 2) describe data obtained
      during a pilot study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the
      drug cefamandole. Plasma concentrations of the drug were measured
      on six healthy volunteers at 14 time points following an
      intraveneous dose of 15 mg/kg body weight of cefamandole.
