         :name: earthquake-intensity

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Earthquake`` data frame has 182 rows and 5 columns.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      Quake
         an ordered factor with levels ``20`` < ``16`` < ``14`` < ``10``
         < ``3`` < ``8`` < ``23`` < ``22`` < ``6`` < ``13`` < ``7`` <
         ``21`` < ``18`` < ``15`` < ``4`` < ``12`` < ``19`` < ``5`` <
         ``9`` < ``1`` < ``2`` < ``17`` < ``11`` indicating the
         earthquake on which the measurements were made.

      Richter
         a numeric vector giving the intensity of the earthquake on the
         Richter scale.

      distance
         the distance from the seismological measuring station to the
         epicenter of the earthquake (km).

      soil
         a factor with levels ``0`` and ``1`` giving the soil condition
         at the measuring station, either soil or rock.

      accel
         maximum horizontal acceleration observed (g).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Measurements recorded at available seismometer locations for 23
      large earthquakes in western North America between 1940 and 1980.
      They were originally given in Joyner and Boore (1981); are
      mentioned in Brillinger (1987); and are analyzed in Davidian and
      Giltinan (1995).
