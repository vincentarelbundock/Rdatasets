<h2 id='Meat'>Tenderness of meat</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Meat</code> data frame has 30 rows and 4 columns.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Storage</dt><dd>
<p>an ordered factor specifying the storage treatment - 1 (0
days), 2 (1 day),  3 (2 days), 4 (4 days), 5 (9 days), and 6
(18 days)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>score</dt><dd>
<p>a numeric vector giving the tenderness score of beef roast.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Block</dt><dd>
<p>an ordered factor identifying the muscle from which the
roast was extracted with levels 
<code>II</code> &lt; <code>V</code> &lt; <code>I</code> &lt; <code>III</code> &lt; <code>IV</code>
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pair</dt><dd>
<p>an ordered factor giving the unique identifier for each pair
of beef roasts with levels <code>II-1</code> &lt; ... &lt; <code>IV-1</code>
</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cochran and Cox (section 11.51, 1957) describe data from an
experiment conducted at Iowa State College (Paul, 1943) to
compare the effects of length of cold storage on the tenderness of
beef roasts.  Six storage periods ranging from 0 to 18 days were used.
Thirty roasts were scored by four judges on a scale from 0 to 10, with
the score increasing with tenderness. The response was the sum of all
four scores. Left and right roasts from the same animal were grouped
into pairs, which were further grouped into five blocks, according to
the muscle from which they were extracted. Different storage periods
were applied to each roast within a pair according to a balanced
incomplete block design.</p>
