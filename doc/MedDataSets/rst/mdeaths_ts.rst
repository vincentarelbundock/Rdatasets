      .. rubric:: Description

      The dataset name has been changed to 'mdeaths_ts' to avoid
      confusion with other datasets from packages in the R ecosystem and
      to follow the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package. The
      suffix '\_ts' indicates that this dataset is a time series,
      helping to distinguish it from other datasets within the package
      and from those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content of
      the dataset has not been modified in any way.
