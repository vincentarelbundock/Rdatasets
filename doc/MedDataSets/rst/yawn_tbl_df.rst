      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The dataset name has been changed to 'yawn_tbl_df' to avoid
      confusion with other datasets from packages in the R ecosystem and
      to follow the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package. The
      suffix '\_tbl_df' indicates that this dataset is a tibble, helping
      to distinguish it from other datasets within the package and from
      those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content of the
      dataset has not been modified in any way.

      A tibble with 50 observations and 2 variables:

      result
         A factor indicating the result of the yawning observation
         (e.g., yawned, did not yawn).

      group
         A factor representing the group to which the participants
         belong (e.g., control, experimental).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This dataset investigates the contagiousness of yawning. It
      includes results from an experiment that examines whether
      individuals yawn more when they are in the presence of someone
      else who is yawning, providing insights into social behaviors and
      contagion phenomena.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      Data collected from a study on yawning contagion.
