      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The dataset name has been changed to 'VADeaths_matrix' to avoid
      confusion with datasets from other packages in the R ecosystem and
      to align with the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package.
      The suffix '\_matrix' indicates that this dataset is a matrix,
      helping to distinguish it from other datasets within the package
      and from datasets in the broader R ecosystem. The original content
      of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
