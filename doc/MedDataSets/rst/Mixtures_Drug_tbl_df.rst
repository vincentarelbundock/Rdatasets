      The dataset name has been changed to 'Mixtures_Drug_tbl_df' to
      avoid confusion with other datasets from packages in the R
      ecosystem and to follow the naming conventions of the

      dataset is a tibble, helping to distinguish it from other datasets
      within the package and from those in the broader R ecosystem. The
      original content of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
