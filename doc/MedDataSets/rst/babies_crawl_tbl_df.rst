         :name: crawling-age

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The dataset name has been changed to 'babies_crawl_tbl_df' to
      avoid confusion with other datasets from packages in the R
      ecosystem and to follow the naming conventions of the
      'MedDataSets' package. The suffix '\_tbl_df' indicates that this
      dataset is a tibble, helping to distinguish it from other datasets
      within the package and from those in the broader R ecosystem. The
      original content of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
