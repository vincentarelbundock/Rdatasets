      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The dataset name has been changed to 'muscle_df' to avoid
      confusion with other datasets from packages in the R ecosystem and
      to follow the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package. The
      suffix '\_df' indicates that this dataset is a data frame, helping
      to distinguish it from other datasets within the package and from
      those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content of the
      dataset has not been modified in any way.

         data(muscle_df)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 60 observations and 3 variables:

      Strip
         A factor indicating the specific muscle strip (with 21 possible
         levels).

      Conc
         A numeric value representing the concentration of calcium
         chloride (in mM).

      Length
         A numeric value indicating the length of the muscle strip (in
         millimeters).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This dataset contains experimental data on the effect of calcium
      chloride on muscle contraction in rat hearts, including
      measurements of muscle strip length and calcium concentration.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source
