         :name: level-of-gag-in-urine-of-children

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The dataset name has been changed to 'GAGurine_df' to avoid
      confusion with other datasets from packages in the R ecosystem and
      to follow the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package. The
      suffix '\_df' indicates that this dataset is a data frame, helping
      to distinguish it from other datasets within the package and from
      those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content of the
      dataset has not been modified in any way.
