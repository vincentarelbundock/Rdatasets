      The dataset name has been changed to 'esoph_df' to avoid confusion
      with datasets from other packages in the R ecosystem and to follow
      the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package. The suffix
      '\_df' indicates that this dataset is a data frame, helping to
      distinguish it from other datasets within the package and from
      those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content of the
      dataset has not been modified in any way.
