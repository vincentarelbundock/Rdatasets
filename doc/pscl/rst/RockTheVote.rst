      A data frame with 85 observations on the following 6 variables.

      ``strata``
         numeric, experimental strata

      ``treated``
         numeric, 1 if a treated cable system, 0 otherwise

      ``r``
         numeric, number of 18 and 19 year olds turning out

      ``n``
         numeric, number of 19 and 19 year olds registered

      ``p``
         numeric, proportion of 18 and 19 year olds turning out

      ``treatedIndex``
         numeric, a counter indexing the 42 treated units

      Green and Vavreck (2008) implemented a cluster-randomized
      experimental design in assessing the effects of a voter
      mobilization treatment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential election. The
      clusters in this design are geographic areas served by a single
      cable television system. So as to facilitate analysis, the
      researchers restricted their attention to small cable systems
      whose reach is limited to a single zip code. Further, since the
      experiment was fielded during the last week of the presidential
      election, the researchers restricted their search to cable systems
      that were not in the 16 hotly-contested “battleground” states (as
      designated by the *Los Angeles Times*).

      Eighty-five cable systems were available for randomization and
      were assigned to treatment after stratification on previous
      turnout levels in presidential elections (as determined from
      analysis of the corresponding states' voter registration files).
      Each cable system was matched with one or sometimes two other
      cable systems in the same state, yielding 40 strata. Then within
      each strata, cable systems were randomly assigned to treatment and
      control conditions. Strata 3, 8 and 25 have two control cable
      systems and 1 treated system each, while strata 6 and 20 have two
      treated cable systems and one control system. The remaining 35
      strata have 1 treated cable system and 1 control system. In this
      way there are 38 + 4 = 42 treated systems, spanning 40 experiment
      strata.

      The treatment involved researchers purchasing prime-time
      advertising spots on four channels in the respective cable system
      in which the researchers aired voter mobilization ads. The ads
      were produced by *Rock the Vote*, targeted at younger voters, and
      aired four times per night, per channel, over the last eight days
      of the election campaign. After the election, public records were
      consulted to assemble data on turnout levels in the treated and
      control cable systems. In the analysis reported in Green and
      Vavreck (2008), the researchers focused on turnout among
      registered voters aged 18 and 19 years old.
