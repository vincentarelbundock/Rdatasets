      In November 1993, the state of Pennsylvania conducted elections
      for its state legislature. The result in the Senate election in
      the 2nd district (based in Philadelphia) was challenged in court,
      and ultimately overturned. The Democratic candidate won 19,127 of
      the votes cast by voting machine, while the Republican won 19,691
      votes cast by voting machine, giving the Republican a lead of 564
      votes. However, the Democrat won 1,396 absentee ballots, while the
      Republican won just 371 absentee ballots, more than offsetting the
      Republican lead based on the votes recorded by machines on
      election day. The Republican candidate sued, claiming that many of
      the absentee ballots were fraudulent. The judge in the case
      solicited expert analysis from Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at
      Princeton University. Ashenfelter examined the relationship
      between absentee vote margins and machine vote margins in 21
      previous Pennsylvania Senate elections in seven districts in the
      Philadelphia area over the preceding decade.
