      These data span only 521 of the 621 seats in the House of Commons
      at the time of 1992 election. Seats missing either a Conservative,
      Labor, or a LibDem candidate appear to have been dropped.

      The original Katz and King data set does not have case labels. I
      used matches to an additional data source to recover a set of
      constituency labels for these data; labels could not recovered for
      two of the constituencies.
