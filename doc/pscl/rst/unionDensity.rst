      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Cross-national data on relative size of the trade unions and
      predictors, in 20 countries. Two of the predictors are highly
      collinear, and are the source of a debate between Stephens and
      Wallerstein (1991), later reviewed by Western and Jackman (1994).

      ``union``
         numeric, percentage of the total number of wage and salary
         earners plus the unemployed who are union members, measured
         between 1975 and 1980, with most of the data drawn from 1979

      ``left``
         numeric, an index tapping the extent to which parties of the
         left have controlled governments since 1919, due to Wilensky
         (1981).

      ``size``
         numeric, log of labor force size, defined as the number of wage
         and salary earners, plus the unemployed

      ``concen``
         numeric, percentage of employment, shipments, or production
         accounted for by the four largest enterprises in a particular
         industry, averaged over industries (with weights proportional
         to the size of the industry) and the resulting measure is
         normalized such that the United States scores a 1.0, and is due
         to Pryor (1973). Some of the scores on this variable are
         imputed using procedures described in Stephens and Wallerstein
         (1991, 945).
