      Aghion et al. (2013) combine several firm level panel datasets
      (e.g., USPTO, SEC and Compustat) to examine the role of
      institutional investors in the governance of innovation. Their
      baseline to model innovation is the Poisson model, but they also
      consider negative binomial models. Berger et al. (2017) argue that
      nonlinearities in the innovation process emerge in case that the
      first innovation is especially hard to obtain in comparison to
      succeeding innovations. Then, hurdle models offer a useful way
      that allows for a distinction between these two processes. Berger
      et al. (2017) show that an extended analysis with negative
      binomial hurdle models differs materially from the outcomes of the
      single-equation Poisson approach of Aghion et al. (2013).

      Institutional ownership (institutions) is defined as the
      proportion of stock owney by institutions. According to Aghion et
      al. (2013), an institutional owner is defined as an institution
      that files a Form 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      (SEC).

      Future cite-weighted patents (cites) are used as a proxy for
      innovation. They are calculated using ultimately granted patent,
      dated by year of application, and weight these by future citations
      through 2002 (see Aghion et al. (2013)).

      The presample average of cite-weighted patents (precites) is used
      by Aghion et al. (2013) as a proxy for unobserved heterogeneity,
      employing the "presample mean scaling" method of Blundell et al.
      (1999).

      The inverse Lerner index in the firm's three-digit industry is
      used as a time-varying measure for product market competition
      (competition), where the Lerner is calculated as the median gross
      margin from the entire Compustat database in the firm's
      three-digit industry (see Aghion et al. (2013)). A time-invariant
      measure for competition (acompetition) is constructed by averaging
      the Lerner over the sample period.

      The classification of institutions into "quasiindexed",
      "transient" and "dedicated" follows Bushee (1998) and
      distinguishes between institutional investors based on their type
      of investing. Quasiindexed institutions are do not trade much and
      are widely diversified, dedicated institution do not trade much
      and have more concentrated holdings, and transient institutions
      often trade and have diversified holdings (see Aghion et al.
      (2013) and Bushee (1998)).
