         :name: format

      An annual time series from 1963 to 1982 with 7 variables.

      GNP
         nominal gross national product (in billion USD),

      Investment
         nominal gross private domestic investment (in billion USD),

      Price
         price index, implicit price deflator for GNP,

      Interest
         interest rate, average yearly discount rate charged by the New
         York Federal Reserve Bank,

      RealGNP
         real GNP (= GNP/Price),

      RealInv
         real investment (= Investment/Price),

      RealInt
         approximation to the real interest rate (= Interest - 100 \*
         diff(Price)/Price).
