      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Artificial balanced panel data set from Petersen (2009) for
      illustrating and benchmarking clustered standard errors.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame containing 5000 observations on 4 variables.

      firm
         integer. Firm identifier (500 firms).

      year
         integer. Time variable (10 years per firm).

      x
         numeric. Independent regressor variable.

      y
         numeric. Dependent response variable.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This simulated data set was created to illustrate and benchmark
      clustered standard errors. The residual and the regressor variable
      both contain a firm effect, but no year effect. Thus, standard
      errors clustered by firm are different from the OLS standard
      errors and similarly double-clustered standard errors (by firm and
      year) are different from the standard errors clustered by year.
