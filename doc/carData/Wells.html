<h2>Well Switching in Bangladesh</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on whether or not households in Bangladesh changed the wells that 
they were using.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>Wells</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 3020 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>switch</code></dt><dd><p>whether or not the household switched to
another well from an unsafe well: <code>no</code> or <code>yes</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>arsenic</code></dt><dd><p>the level of arsenic contamination in the 
household's original well, in hundreds of micrograms per liter; all
are above 0.5, which was the level identified as &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>distance</code></dt><dd><p>in meters to the closest known safe well.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>education</code></dt><dd><p>in years of the head of the household.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>association</code></dt><dd><p>whether or not any members of the household

</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are for an area of Arahazar upazila, Bangladesh.
The researchers labelled each well with its level of arsenic and an
indication of whether the well was &ldquo;safe&rdquo; or &ldquo;unsafe.&rdquo; Those using unsafe
wells were encouraged to switch. After several years, it was determined
whether each household using an unsafe well had changed its well. 
These data are used by Gelman and Hill (2007) for a logistic-regression example.
