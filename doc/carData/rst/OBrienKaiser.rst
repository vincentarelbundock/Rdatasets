      .. rubric:: O'Brien and Kaiser's Repeated-Measures Data
         :name: obrien-and-kaisers-repeated-measures-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      These contrived repeated-measures data are taken from O'Brien and
      Kaiser (1985). The data are from an imaginary study in which 16
      female and male subjects, who are divided into three treatments,
      are measured at a pretest, postest, and a follow-up session;
      during each session, they are measured at five occasions at
      intervals of one hour. The design, therefore, has two
      between-subject and two within-subject factors.

      The contrasts for the ``treatment`` factor are set to ``-2, 1, 1``
      and ``0, -1, 1``. The contrasts for the ``gender`` factor are set
      to ``contr.sum``.
