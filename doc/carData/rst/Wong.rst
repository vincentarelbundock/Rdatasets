      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data are from Wong, Monette, and Weiner (2001) and are for 200
      patients who sustained traumatic brain injuries resulting in comas
      of varying duration. After awakening from their comas, patients
      were periodically administered a standard IQ test, but the average
      number of measurements per patient is small (331/200 = 1.7).
