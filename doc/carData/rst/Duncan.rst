      This data frame contains the following columns:

      type
         Type of occupation. A factor with the following levels:
         ``prof``, professional and managerial; ``wc``, white-collar;
         ``bc``, blue-collar.

      income
         Percentage of occupational incumbents in the 1950 US Census who
         earned $3,500 or more per year (about $36,000 in 2017 US
         dollars).

      education
         Percentage of occupational incumbents in 1950 who were high
         school graduates (which, were we cynical, we would say is
         roughly equivalent to a PhD in 2017)

         occupation as “good” or better in prestige
