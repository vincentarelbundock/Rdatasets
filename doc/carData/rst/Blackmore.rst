      This data frame contains the following columns:

      subject
         a factor with subject id codes. There are several observations
         for each subject, but because the girls were hospitalized at
         different ages, the number of cases and the age at the last
         case vary.

      age
         subject's age in years at the time of observation; all but the
         last observation for each subject were collected
         retrospectively at intervals of two years, starting at age 8.

      exercise
         the amount of exercise in which the subject engaged, expressed
         as estimated hours per week.

      group
         a factor with levels: ``control``, Control subjects;
         ``patient``, Eating-disordered patients.
