         :name: description

      Soil characteristics were measured on samples from three types of
      contours (Top, Slope, and Depression) and at four depths (0-10cm,
      10-30cm, 30-60cm, and 60-90cm). The area was divided into 4
      blocks, in a randomized block design. (Suggested by Michael
      Friendly.)

      A data frame with 48 observations on the following 14 variables.
      There are 3 factors and 9 response variables.

      ``Group``
         a factor with 12 levels, corresponding to the combinations of
         ``Contour`` and ``Depth``

      ``Contour``
         a factor with 3 levels: ``Depression`` ``Slope`` ``Top``

      ``Depth``
         a factor with 4 levels: ``0-10`` ``10-30`` ``30-60`` ``60-90``

      ``Gp``
         a factor with 12 levels, giving abbreviations for the groups:
         ``D0`` ``D1`` ``D3`` ``D6`` ``S0`` ``S1`` ``S3`` ``S6`` ``T0``
         ``T1`` ``T3`` ``T6``

      ``Block``
         a factor with levels ``1`` ``2`` ``3`` ``4``

      ``pH``
         soil pH

      ``N``
         total nitrogen in %

      ``Dens``
         bulk density in gm/cm$^3$

      ``P``
         total phosphorous in ppm

      ``Ca``
         calcium in me/100 gm.

      ``Mg``
         magnesium in me/100 gm.

      ``K``
         phosphorous in me/100 gm.

      ``Na``
         sodium in me/100 gm.

      ``Conduc``
         conductivity

      These data provide good examples of MANOVA and canonical
      discriminant analysis in a somewhat complex multivariate setting.
      They may be treated as a one-way design (ignoring ``Block``), by
      using either ``Group`` or ``Gp`` as the factor, or a two-way
      randomized block design using ``Block``, ``Contour`` and ``Depth``
      (quantitative, so orthogonal polynomial contrasts are useful).
