      The ``Adler`` data frame has 108 rows and 3 columns.

      The “experimenters” were the actual subjects of the study. They
      collected ratings of the apparent success of people in pictures
      who were pre-selected for their average appearance of success. The
      experimenters were told prior to collecting data that particular
      subjects were either high or low in their tendency to rate
      appearance of success, and were instructed to get good data,
      scientific data, or were given no such instruction. Each
      experimenter collected ratings from 18 randomly assigned subjects.
      This version of the Adler data is taken from Erickson and
      Nosanchuk (1977). The data described in the original source, Adler
      (1973), have a more complex structure.
