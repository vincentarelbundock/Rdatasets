      :name: description

   The ``Adler`` data frame has 108 rows and 3 columns.

   The “experimenters” were the actual subjects of the study. They
   collected ratings of the apparent success of people in pictures who
   were pre-selected for their average appearance of success. The
   experimenters were told prior to collecting data that particular
   subjects were either high or low in their tendency to rate appearance
   of success, and were instructed to get good data, scientific data, or
   were given no such instruction. Each experimenter collected ratings
   from 18 randomly assigned subjects. This version of the Adler data is
   taken from Erickson and Nosanchuk (1977). The data described in the
   original source, Adler (1973), have a more complex structure.
