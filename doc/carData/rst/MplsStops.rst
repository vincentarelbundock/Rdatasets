      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      A few stops have been deleted, either because thesu location data
      was missing, or a few very rare categories were also removed. The
      data frame ``MplsDemo`` contains 2015 demongraphic data on
      Minneapolis neighborhoods, using the same neighborhood names as
      this data file. Demographics are available for 84 of Minneaolis'
      87 neighborhoods. The remaining 3 presumably have no housing.
