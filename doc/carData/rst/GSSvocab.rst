      ``id_``, ``age``, ``educ``, ``sex``, ``born`` and ``wordsum``. The
      GSS began in 1972, and has included several thousand data items,
      some regularly and some only once, on topics of interest to social
      scientists. Data have been slightly edited to change entires like
      ``No answer`` and ``Not applicable`` to missing value codes.
