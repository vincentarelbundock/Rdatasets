      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 3020 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``switch``
         whether or not the household switched to another well from an
         unsafe well: ``no`` or ``yes``.

      ``arsenic``
         the level of arsenic contamination in the household's original
         well, in hundreds of micrograms per liter; all are above 0.5,
         which was the level identified as “safe”.

      ``distance``
         in meters to the closest known safe well.

      ``education``
         in years of the head of the household.

      ``association``
         whether or not any members of the household participated in any
         community organizations: ``no`` or ``yes``.

      The data are for an area of Arahazar upazila, Bangladesh. The
      researchers labelled each well with its level of arsenic and an
      indication of whether the well was “safe” or “unsafe.” Those using
      unsafe wells were encouraged to switch. After several years, it
      was determined whether each household using an unsafe well had
      changed its well. These data are used by Gelman and Hill (2007)
      for a logistic-regression example.
