      A data frame with 84 observations on the following 9 variables.

      ``pool``
         a factor with levels ``1`` ``2`` ``3`` ``4`` ``5`` ``6`` ``7``
         ``8`` ``9`` ``10`` ``11`` ``12`` denoting the 12 pools used in
         the experiment; each pool had a different level of drug.

      ``I1L1``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      ``I1L2``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      ``I2L1``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      ``I2L2``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      ``I3L1``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      ``I3L2``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      ``I4L1``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      ``I4L2``
         a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of
         drug in the assay

      Important characteristics of a clinical chemistry assay are its
      limit of blank (LoB), and its limit of detection (LoD). The LoB,
      conceptually the highest reading likely to be obtained from a
      zero-concentration sample, is defined operationally by the upper
      95% point of readings obtained from samples that do not contain
      the analyte. The LoD, conceptually the lowest level of analyte
      that can be reliably determined not to be blank, is defined
      operationally as true value at which there is a 95% chance of the
      reading being above the LoB.

      These data are from a portion of a LoB/D study of an assay for a
      drug used to treat certain cancers. Twelve pools were used, four
      of them blanks of different types, and eight with successively
      increasing drug levels. The 8 columns of the data set refer to
      measurements made using different instruments I and reagent lots
      L.

      Used as an illustrative application for Box-Cox type
      transformations with negative values in Hawkins and Weisberg
      (2015). For examples of its use, see ``bcnPower``.
