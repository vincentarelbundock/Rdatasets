<h2>School Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>School Data, from Charnes et al. (1981), a large scale social experiment in public school education.
It was conceived in the late 1960's as a federally sponsored program charged with providing remedial
assistance to educationally disadvantaged early primary school students.
One aim is to explain scores on 3
different tests, <code>reading</code>, <code>mathematics</code> and <code>selfesteem</code>
from 70 school sites by means of 5 explanatory variables related to parents
and teachers.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 70 observations on the following 8 variables.
</p>
 
<dl>
<dt><code>education</code></dt><dd><p>Education level of mother as measured by the percentage of high school graduates among female parents</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>occupation</code></dt><dd><p>Highest occupation of a family member according
to a pre-arranged rating scale</p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>visit</code></dt><dd><p> Parental visits index,
representing the number of visits to the school site</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>counseling</code></dt><dd><p>Parent counseling index, calculated from data on
time spent with child on school-related topics such as reading together, etc.</p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>teacher</code></dt><dd><p>Number of teachers at the given site</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>reading</code></dt><dd><p> Reading score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test</p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>mathematics</code></dt><dd><p>Mathematics score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test</p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>selfesteem</code></dt><dd><p>Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, intended as a measure of self-esteem</p>
</dd> 
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A number of observations are unusual, a fact only revealed by
plotting.
</p>
<p>The study was designed to compare schools using Program Follow Through (PFT)
management methods of taking actions to achieve goals with those of
Non Follow Through (NFT). Observations <code>1:49</code> came from PFT sites
and <code>50:70</code> from NFT sites.
This and other descriptors are contained in the dataset <code>schoolsites</code>.
</p>

<p>This dataset was came originally from the (now-defunct) <code>FRB</code> package.
