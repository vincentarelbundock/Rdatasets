      The primary purpose of the study (Hartman, 2016, Heinrichs et al.
      (2015)) was to evaluate patterns and levels of performance on
      neurocognitive measures among individuals with schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder using a well-validated, comprehensive
      neurocognitive battery specifically designed for individuals with
      psychosis (Heinrichs et al. (2008))

      A data frame with 242 observations on the following 10 variables.

      ``Dx``
         Diagnostic group, a factor with levels ``Schizophrenia``
         ``Schizoaffective`` ``Control``

      ``Speed``
         Speed of processing domain T score, a numeric vector

      ``Attention``
         Attention/Vigilance Domain T score, a numeric vector

      ``Memory``
         Working memory a numeric vector

      ``Verbal``
         Verbal Learning Domain T score, a numeric vector

      ``Visual``
         Visual Learning Domain T score, a numeric vector

      ``ProbSolv``
         Reasoning/Problem Solving Domain T score, a numeric vector

      ``SocialCog``
         Social Cognition Domain T score, a numeric vector

      The main interest was in determining how well these measures
      distinguished among all groups and whether there were variables
      that distinguished between the schizophrenia and schizoaffective
      groups.

      Neurocognitive function was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus
      Cognitive Battery (MCCB; Nuechterlein et al., 2008). The MCCB
      consists of 10 individually administered tests that measure
      cognitive performance in seven domains: speed of processing,
      attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual
      learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition.

      The clinical sample comprised 116 male and female patients who met
      the following criteria: 1) a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 70)
      or schizoaffective disorder (n = 46) confirmed by the Structured
      Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders; 2) outpatient
      status; 3) a history free of developmental or learning disability;
      4) age 18-65; 5) a history free of neurological or endocrine
      disorder; and 6) no concurrent DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of substance
      use disorder.

      Non-psychiatric control participants (n = 146) were screened for
      medical and psychiatric illness and history of substance abuse.
      Patients were recruited from three outpatient clinics in Hamilton,
      Ontario, Canada. Control participants were recruited through local
      newspaper and online classified advertisements for paid research
      participation.
