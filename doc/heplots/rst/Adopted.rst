      .. rubric:: Adopted Children
         :name: adopted-children

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data are a subset from an observational, longitudinal, study on
      adopted children. Is child's intelligence related to intelligence
      of the biological mother and the intelligence of the adoptive
      mother?

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 62 observations on the following 6 variables.

      ``AMED``
         adoptive mother's years of education (proxy for her IQ)

      ``BMIQ``
         biological mother's score on IQ test

      ``Age2IQ``
         IQ of child at age 2

      ``Age4IQ``
         IQ of child at age 4

      ``Age8IQ``
         IQ of child at age 8

      ``Age13IQ``
         IQ of child at age 13

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The child's intelligence was measured at age 2, 4, 8, and 13 for
      this sample. How does intelligence change over time, and how are
      these changes related to intelligence of the birth and adoptive
      mother?
