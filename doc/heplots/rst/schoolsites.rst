      .. rubric:: Schooldata Sites
         :name: schooldata-sites

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Descriptors for the sites of the ``schooldata`` dataset, from
      Charnes et al. (1981). The study was designed to compare schools
      using Program Follow Through (PFT) management methods of taking
      actions to achieve goals with those of Non Follow Through (NFT).
      Observations ``1:49`` came from PFT sites and ``50:70`` from NFT
      sites. This dataset gives other descriptors for the sites, from
      their Exhibit C.
