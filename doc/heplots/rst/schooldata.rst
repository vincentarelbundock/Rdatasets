         :name: description

      School Data, from Charnes et al. (1981). The aim is to explain
      scores on 3 different tests, ``reading``, ``mathematics`` and
      ``selfesteem`` from 70 school sites by means of 5 explanatory
      variables related to parents and teachers.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 70 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``education``
         Education level of mother as measured in terms of percentage of
         high school graduates among female parents

      ``occupation``
         Highest occupation of a family member according to a
         pre-arranged rating scale

      ``visit``
         Parental visits index representing the number of visits to the
         school site

      ``counseling``
         Parent counseling index calculated from data on time spent with
         child on school-related topics such as reading together, etc.

      ``teacher``
         Number of teachers at a given site

      ``reading``
         Reading score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test

      ``mathematics``
         Mathematics score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement
         Test

      ``selfesteem``
         Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, intended as a measure of
         self-esteem

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This dataset was shamelessly borrowed from the ``FRB`` package.

      The relationships among these variables are unusual, a fact only
      revealed by plotting.
