      .. rubric:: Taste Ratings of Japanese Rice Wine (Sake)
         :name: taste-ratings-of-japanese-rice-wine-sake

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Siotani et al. (1985) describe a study of Japanese rice wine
      (sake) used to investigate the relationship between two subjective
      ratings (``taste`` and ``smell``) and a number of physical
      measurements on 30 brands of sake.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 30 observations on the following 10 variables.

      ``taste``
         mean taste rating

      ``smell``
         mean smell rating

      ``pH``
         pH measurement

      ``acidity1``
         one measure of acidity

      ``acidity2``
         another measure of acidity

      ``sake``
         Sake-meter score

      ``rsugar``
         direct reducing sugar content

      ``tsugar``
         total sugar content

      ``alcohol``
         alcohol content

      ``nitrogen``
         formol-nitrogen content

      These data provide one example of a case where a multivariate
      regression doesn't benefit from having multiple outcome measures,
      using the standard tests. Barrett (2003) uses this data to
      illustrate influence measures for multivariate regression models.

      The ``taste`` and ``smell`` values are the mean ratings of 10
      experts on some unknown scale.
