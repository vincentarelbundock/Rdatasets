      .. rubric:: Treatment of Headache Sufferers for Sensitivity to
         Noise

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A study was conducted investigating the effectiveness of different
      kinds of psychological treatment on the sensitivity of headache
      sufferers to noise, described in Hand and Taylor (1987), Study E.

      A data frame with 98 observations on the following 6 variables.

      ``type``
         Type of headache, a factor with levels ``Migrane`` ``Tension``

      ``treatment``
         Treatment group, a factor with levels ``T1`` ``T2`` ``T3``
         ``Control``. See Details

      ``u1``
         Noise level rated as Uncomfortable, initial measure

      ``du1``
         Noise level rated as Definitely Uncomfortable, initial measure

      ``u2``
         Noise level rated as Uncomfortable, final measure

      ``du2``
         Noise level rated as Definitely Uncomfortable, final measure

      In a pre-post design, 98 patients were first assessed for the
      volume of noise which they found uncomfortable (U) and definitely
      uncomfortable (DU). They were then given relaxation training,
      where they listened to the noise at the DU level and given
      instruction breathing techniques and the use of visual imagery to
      distract them from discomfort. One of four treatments was then
      applied, and all patients were reassessed for the noise volume
      they considered uncomfortable (U) and definitely uncomfortable
      (DU).

      The treatments are described as follows:

      ``T1``
         Listened again to the tone at their initial DU level, for the
         same amount of time they were able to tolerate it before.

      ``T2``
         Same as T1, with one additional minute exposure

      ``T3``
         Same as T2, but were explicitly instructed to use the
         relaxation techniques

      ``Control``
         These subject experienced no further exposure to the noise tone
         until the final sensitivity measures were taken

      Hand and Taylor described several substantive hypotheses related
      to the differences among treatments. In the ``Headache`` data
      frame, these have been included as
      ``contrasts(Headache$treatment)``
