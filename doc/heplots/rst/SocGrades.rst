      .. rubric:: Grades in a Sociology Course
         :name: grades-in-a-sociology-course

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The data set ``SocGrades`` contains four outcome measures on
      student performance in an introductory sociology course together
      with six potential predictors. These data were used by Marascuilo
      and Levin (1983) for an example of canonical correlation analysis,
      but are also suitable as examples of multivariate multiple
      regression, MANOVA, MANCOVA and step-down analysis in multivariate
      linear models.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 40 observations on the following 10 variables.

      ``class``
         Social class, an ordered factor with levels ``1`` > ``2`` >
         ``3``

      ``sex``
         sex, a factor with levels ``F`` ``M``

      ``gpa``
         grade point average

      ``boards``
         College Board test scores

      ``hssoc``
         previous high school unit in sociology, a factor with 2 ``no``,
         ``yes``

      ``pretest``
         score on course pretest

      ``midterm1``
         score on first midterm exam

      ``midterm2``
         score on second midterm exam

      ``final``
         score on final exam

      ``eval``
         course evaluation

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``midterm1``, ``midterm2``, ``final``, and possibly ``eval`` are
      the response variables. All other variables are potential
      predictors.

      The factors ``class``, ``sex``, and ``hssoc`` can be used with
      ``as.numeric`` in correlational analyses.
