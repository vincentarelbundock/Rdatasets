      .. rubric:: Response Speed in a Probe Experiment
         :name: response-speed-in-a-probe-experiment

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from a probe experiment testing whether immediate memory for
      sentences is influenced by the phrase structure of the sentence.
      The data sets come from Timm (1975), Ex. 3.14 and Ex. 3.16 (p.244)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      ``Probe1``: A data frame with 11 observations on the following 5
      variables.

      ``p1``
         speed at position 1

      ``p2``
         speed at position 2

      ``p3``
         speed at position 3

      ``p4``
         speed at position 4

      ``p5``
         speed at position 5

      ``Probe2``: A data frame with 20 observations on the following 6
      variables.

      ``stm``
         Short term memory capacity: a factor with levels ``High``
         ``Low``

      ``p1``
         speed at position 1

      ``p2``
         speed at position 2

      ``p3``
         speed at position 3

      ``p4``
         speed at position 4

      ``p5``
         speed at position 5

      Procedure: Subjects listened to tape-recorded sentences. Each
      sentence was followed by a "probe word" from one of 5 positions
      within the sentence. The subject had to respond with the word
      which immediately followed the probe word in the sentence. The
      dependent measure is response speed = k(1/reaction time).

      Sample sentence:

      ::

         *       The tall man met the young girl who got the new hat.
         Pos'ns:      1    2            3    4    5
         Function:   ADJ1 SUBJ        ADJ2  OBJ  REL.PN

      In ``Probe2``, there are two groups of subjects, pre-selected on a
      test of short term memory.

      These data sets (fictitious) are used as examples of single-sample
      and two-sample profile analysis or simple repeated measure designs
      with structured contrasts.
