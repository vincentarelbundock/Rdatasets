      .. rubric:: Adolescent Mental Health Data
         :name: adolescent-mental-health-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data was taken from the National Longitudinal Study of
      Adolescent Health. It is a cross-sectional sample of participants
      from grades 7â€“12, described and analyzed by Warne (2014).

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 4344 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``grade``
         an ordered factor with levels ``7`` < ``8`` < ``9`` < ``10`` <
         ``11`` < ``12``

      ``depression``
         a numeric vector

      ``anxiety``
         a numeric vector

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``depression`` is the response to the question "In the last month,
      how often did you feel depressed or blue?"

      ``anxiety`` is the response to the question "In the last month,
      how often did you have trouble relaxing?"

      The responses for ``depression`` and ``anxiety`` were recorded on
      a 5-point Likert scale, with categories
      ``0="Never", 1="Rarely", 2="Occasionally", 3="Often", 4="Every day"``
