      .. rubric:: Chemical Analysis of Romano-British Pottery
         :name: chemical-analysis-of-romano-british-pottery

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Results of chemical analyses of 48 specimens of Romano-British
      pottery published by Tubb et al. (1980). The numbers are the
      percentage of various metal oxides found in each sample for
      elements of concentrations greater than 0.01%. This is the
      original data set from Tubb et al. (1980), in contrast to
      ``Pottery``.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 48 observations on the following 12 variables.

      ``Region``
         a factor with levels ``Gl`` ``NF`` ``Wales``

      ``Site``
         a factor with levels ``AshleyRails`` ``Caldicot``
         ``Gloucester`` ``IsleThorns`` ``Llanedryn``

      ``Kiln``
         a factor with levels ``1`` ``2`` ``3`` ``4`` ``5``

      ``Al``
         amount of aluminum oxide, ``Al_2O_3``

      ``Fe``
         amount of iron oxide, ``Fe_2O_3``

      ``Mg``
         amount of magnesium oxide, MgO

      ``Ca``
         amount of calcium oxide, CaO

      ``Na``
         amount of sodium oxide, ``Na_2O``

      ``K``
         amount of potassium oxide, ``K_2O``

      ``Ti``
         amount of titanium oxide, ``TiO_2``

      ``Mn``
         amount of manganese oxide, MnO

      ``Ba``
         amount of BaO

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The specimens are identified by their ``rownames`` in the data
      frame. ``Kiln`` indicates at which kiln site the pottery was
      found; ``Site`` gives the location names of those sites. The kiln
      sites come from three ``Region``\ s,
      ``("Gl"=1, "Wales"=(2, 3), "NF"=(4, 5))``, where the full names
      are "Gloucester", "Wales", and "New Forrest".

      The variable ``Kiln`` comes pre-supplied with contrasts to test
      interesting hypotheses related to ``Site`` and ``Region``.
