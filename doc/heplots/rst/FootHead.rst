      .. rubric:: Head measurements of football players
         :name: head-measurements-of-football-players

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data collected as part of a preliminary study examining the
      relation between football helmet design and neck injuries. There
      are 30 subjects in each of three groups: High school football
      players, college players and non-football players.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 90 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``group``
         a factor with levels ``High school`` ``College``
         ``Non-football``

      ``width``
         a numeric vector: head width at widest dimension

      ``circum``
         a numeric vector: head circumference

      ``front.back``
         a numeric vector: front to back distance at eye level

      ``eye.top``
         a numeric vector: eye to top of head

      ``ear.top``
         a numeric vector:ear to top of head

      ``jaw``
         a numeric vector: jaw width
