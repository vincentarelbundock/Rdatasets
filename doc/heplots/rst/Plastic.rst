      .. rubric:: Plastic Film Data
         :name: plastic-film-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      An experiment was conducted to determine the optimum conditions
      for extruding plastic film. Three responses were measured in
      relation to two factors, rate of extrusion and amount of an
      additive.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 20 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``tear``
         a numeric vector: tear resistance

      ``gloss``
         a numeric vector: film gloss

      ``opacity``
         a numeric vector: film opacity

      ``rate``
         a factor representing change in the rate of extrusion with
         levels ``Low`` (-10%), ``High`` (10%)

      ``additive``
         a factor with levels ``Low`` (1.0%), ``High`` (1.5%)
