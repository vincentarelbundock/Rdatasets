<h2>
Channing House Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>channing</code> data frame has 462 rows and 5 columns.
</p>
<p>Channing House is a retirement centre in Palo Alto, California.  These data 
were
collected between the opening of the house in 1964 until July 1, 1975.  In that
time 97 men and 365 women passed through the centre.  For each of these, their
age on entry and also on leaving or death was recorded.  A large number of the
observations were censored mainly due to the resident being alive on July 1,
1975 when the data was collected.  Over the time of the study 130 women and
46 men died at Channing House.  Differences between the survival of the sexes,
taking age into account, was one of the primary concerns of this study.
