      .. rubric:: Car Speeding and Warning Signs

         :name: description

      The ``amis`` data frame has 8437 rows and 4 columns.

      In a study into the effect that warning signs have on speeding
      patterns, Cambridgeshire County Council considered 14 pairs of
      locations. The locations were paired to account for factors such
      as traffic volume and type of road. One site in each pair had a
      sign erected warning of the dangers of speeding and asking drivers
      to slow down. No action was taken at the second site. Three sets
      of measurements were taken at each site. Each set of measurements
      was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not all sites have
      exactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were taken
      before the erection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the
      sign, and again after the sign had been in place for some time.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``speed``
         Speeds of cars (in miles per hour).

      ``period``
         A numeric column indicating the time that the reading was
         taken. A value of 1 indicates a reading taken before the sign
         was erected, a 2 indicates a reading taken shortly after
         erection of the sign and a 3 indicates a reading taken after
         the sign had been in place for some time.

      ``warning``
         A numeric column indicating whether the location of the reading
         was chosen to have a warning sign erected. A value of 1
         indicates presence of a sign and a value of 2 indicates that no
         sign was erected.

      ``pair``
         A numeric column giving the pair number at which the reading
         was taken. Pairs were numbered from 1 to 14.
