      .. rubric:: Position of Muscle Caveolae
         :name: position-of-muscle-caveolae

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``cav`` data frame has 138 rows and 2 columns.

      The data gives the positions of the individual caveolae in a
      square region with sides of length 500 units. This grid was
      originally on a 2.65mum square of muscle fibre. The data are those
      points falling in the lower left hand quarter of the region used
      for the dataset ``caveolae.dat`` in the spatial package by B.D.
      Ripley (1994).
