      The ``paulsen`` data frame has 346 rows and 1 columns.

      Sections were prepared from the brain of adult guinea pigs.
      Spontaneous currents that flowed into individual brain cells were
      then recorded and the peak amplitude of each current measured. The
      aim of the experiment was to see if the current flow was quantal
      in nature (i.e. that it is not a single burst but instead is built
      up of many smaller bursts of current). If the current was indeed
      quantal then it would be expected that the distribution of the
      current amplitude would be multimodal with modes at regular
      intervals. The modes would be expected to decrease in magnitude
      for higher current amplitudes.

      This data frame contains the following column:

      ``y``
         The current flowing into individual brain cells. The currents
         are measured in pico-amperes.
