      ``neuro`` is a matrix containing times of observed firing of a
      neuron in windows of 250ms either side of the application of a
      stimulus to a human subject. Each row of the matrix is a
      replication of the experiment and there were a total of 469
      replicates.

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      There are a lot of missing values in the matrix as different
      numbers of firings were observed in different replicates. The
      number of firings observed varied from 2 to 6.
