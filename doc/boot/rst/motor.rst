      .. rubric:: Data from a Simulated Motorcycle Accident
         :name: data-from-a-simulated-motorcycle-accident

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``motor`` data frame has 94 rows and 4 columns. The rows are
      obtained by removing replicate values of ``time`` from the dataset
      ``mcycle``. Two extra columns are added to allow for strata with a
      different residual variance in each stratum.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``times``
         The time in milliseconds since impact.

      ``accel``
         The recorded head acceleration (in g).

      ``strata``
         A numeric column indicating to which of the three strata
         (numbered 1, 2 and 3) the observations belong.

      ``v``
         An estimate of the residual variance for the observation. ``v``
         is constant within the strata but a different estimate is used
         for each of the three strata.
