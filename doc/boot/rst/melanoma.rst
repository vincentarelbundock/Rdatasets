         :name: description

      The ``melanoma`` data frame has 205 rows and 7 columns.

      The data consist of measurements made on patients with malignant
      melanoma. Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the
      Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense,
      Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of
      complete removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the
      surrounding skin. Among the measurements taken were the thickness
      of the tumour and whether it was ulcerated or not. These are
      thought to be important prognostic variables in that patients with
      a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death
      from melanoma. Patients were followed until the end of 1977.
