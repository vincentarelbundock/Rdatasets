      :name: tuna

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``tuna`` data frame has 64 rows and 1 columns.

   The data come from an aerial line transect survey of Southern Bluefin
   Tuna in the Great Australian Bight. An aircraft with two spotters on
   board flies randomly allocated line transects. Each school of tuna
   sighted is counted and its perpendicular distance from the transect
   measured. The survey was conducted in summer when tuna tend to stay
   on the surface.
