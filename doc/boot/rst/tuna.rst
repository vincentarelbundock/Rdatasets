      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``tuna`` data frame has 64 rows and 1 columns.

      The data come from an aerial line transect survey of Southern
      Bluefin Tuna in the Great Australian Bight. An aircraft with two
      spotters on board flies randomly allocated line transects. Each
      school of tuna sighted is counted and its perpendicular distance
      from the transect measured. The survey was conducted in summer
      when tuna tend to stay on the surface.
