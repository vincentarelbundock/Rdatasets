   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``nitrofen`` data frame has 50 rows and 5 columns.

   Nitrofen is a herbicide that was used extensively for the control of
   broad-leaved and grass weeds in cereals and rice. Although it is
   relatively non-toxic to adult mammals, nitrofen is a significant
   tetragen and mutagen. It is also acutely toxic and reproductively
   toxic to cladoceran zooplankton. Nitrofen is no longer in commercial
   use in the U.S., having been the first pesticide to be withdrawn due
   to tetragenic effects.

   The data here come from an experiment to measure the reproductive
   toxicity of nitrofen on a species of zooplankton (*Ceriodaphnia
   dubia*). 50 animals were randomized into batches of 10 and each batch
   was put in a solution with a measured concentration of nitrofen. Then
   the number of live offspring in each of the three broods to each
   animal was recorded.
