      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``nitrofen`` data frame has 50 rows and 5 columns.

      Nitrofen is a herbicide that was used extensively for the control
      of broad-leaved and grass weeds in cereals and rice. Although it
      is relatively non-toxic to adult mammals, nitrofen is a
      significant tetragen and mutagen. It is also acutely toxic and
      reproductively toxic to cladoceran zooplankton. Nitrofen is no
      longer in commercial use in the U.S., having been the first
      pesticide to be withdrawn due to tetragenic effects.

      The data here come from an experiment to measure the reproductive
      toxicity of nitrofen on a species of zooplankton (*Ceriodaphnia
      dubia*). 50 animals were randomized into batches of 10 and each
      batch was put in a solution with a measured concentration of
      nitrofen. Then the number of live offspring in each of the three
      broods to each animal was recorded.

      ``brood2``
         The number of live offspring in the second brood.

      ``brood3``
         The number of live offspring in the third brood.

      ``total``
