         :name: description

      The ``manaus`` time series is of class ``"ts"`` and has 1080
      observations on one variable.

      The data values are monthly averages of the daily stages (heights)
      of the Rio Negro at Manaus. Manaus is 18km upstream from the
      confluence of the Rio Negro with the Amazon but because of the
      tiny slope of the water surface and the lower courses of its
      flatland affluents, they may be regarded as a good approximation
      of the water level in the Amazon at the confluence. The data here
      cover 90 years from January 1903 until December 1992.

      The Manaus gauge is tied in with an arbitrary bench mark of 100m
      set in the steps of the Municipal Prefecture; gauge readings are
      usually referred to sea level, on the basis of a mark on the steps
      leading to the Parish Church (Matriz), which is assumed to lie at
      an altitude of 35.874 m according to observations made many years
      ago under the direction of Samuel Pereira, an engineer in charge
      of the Manaus Sanitation Committee Whereas such an altitude
      cannot, by any means, be considered to be a precise datum point,
      observations have been provisionally referred to it. The
      measurements are in metres.
