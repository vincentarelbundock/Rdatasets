      The ``claridge`` data frame has 37 rows and 2 columns.

      The data are from an experiment which was designed to look for a
      relationship between a certain genetic characteristic and
      handedness. The 37 subjects were women who had a son with mental
      retardation due to inheriting a defective X-chromosome. For each
      such mother a genetic measurement of their DNA was made. Larger
      values of this measurement are known to be linked to the defective
      gene and it was hypothesized that larger values might also be
      linked to a progressive shift away from right-handednesss. Each
      woman also filled in a questionnaire regarding which hand they
      used for various tasks. From these questionnaires a measure of
      hand preference was found for each mother. The scale of this
      measure goes from 1, indicating someone who always favours their
      right hand, to 8, indicating someone who always favours their left
      hand. Between these two extremes are people who favour one hand
      for some tasks and the other for other tasks.
