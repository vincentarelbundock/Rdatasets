      .. rubric:: Darwin's Plant Height Differences

         :name: description

      The ``darwin`` data frame has 15 rows and 1 columns.

      Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority
      of cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants. 15 pairs
      of plants were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized
      plant and one self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same
      time and grew in the same pot. The plants were measured at a fixed
      time after planting and the difference in heights between the
      cross- and self-fertilized plants are recorded in eighths of an
      inch.
