      .. rubric:: Beaver Body Temperature Data
         :name: beaver-body-temperature-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``beaver`` data frame has 100 rows and 4 columns. It is a
      multivariate time series of class ``"ts"`` and also inherits from
      class ``"data.frame"``.

      This data set is part of a long study into body temperature
      regulation in beavers. Four adult female beavers were live-trapped
      and had a temperature-sensitive radio transmitter surgically
      implanted. Readings were taken every 10 minutes. The location of
      the beaver was also recorded and her activity level was
      dichotomized by whether she was in the retreat or outside of it
      since high-intensity activities only occur outside of the retreat.

      The data in this data frame are those readings for one of the
      beavers on a day in autumn.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``day``
         The day number. The data includes only data from day 307 and
         early 308.

      ``time``
         The time of day formatted as hour-minute.

      ``temp``
         The body temperature in degrees Celsius.

      ``activ``
         The dichotomized activity indicator. ``1`` indicates that the
         beaver is outside of the retreat and therefore engaged in
         high-intensity activity.
