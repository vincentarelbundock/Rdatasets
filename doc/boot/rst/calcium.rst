         :name: description

      The ``calcium`` data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns.

      Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State
      University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of
      intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma
      membrane. Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive
      calcium for a certain length of time and then the amount of
      radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was measured.
      The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different times
      of suspension each replicated 3 times.
