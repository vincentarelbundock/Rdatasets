   .. rubric:: Calcium Uptake Data
      :name: calcium

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``calcium`` data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns.

   Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State
   University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of
   intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma
   membrane. Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium
   for a certain length of time and then the amount of radioactive
   calcium that was absorbed by the cells was measured. The experiment
   was repeated independently with 9 different times of suspension each
   replicated 3 times.
