      :name: description

   The ``urine`` data frame has 79 rows and 7 columns.

   79 urine specimens were analyzed in an effort to determine if certain

   This data frame contains the following columns:

   ``r``
      Indicator of the presence of calcium oxalate crystals.

   ``gravity``
      The specific gravity of the urine.

   ``ph``
      The pH reading of the urine.

   ``osmo``
      The osmolarity of the urine. Osmolarity is proportional to the
      concentration of molecules in solution.

   ``cond``
      The conductivity of the urine. Conductivity is proportional to the
      concentration of charged ions in solution.

   ``urea``
      The urea concentration in millimoles per litre.

   ``calc``
      The calcium concentration in millimoles per litre.
