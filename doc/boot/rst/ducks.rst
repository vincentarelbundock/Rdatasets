      .. rubric:: Behavioral and Plumage Characteristics of Hybrid Ducks

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``ducks`` data frame has 11 rows and 2 columns.

      Each row of the data frame represents a male duck who is a second
      generation cross of mallard and pintail ducks. For 11 such ducks a
      behavioural and plumage index were calculated. These were measured
      on scales devised for this experiment which was to examine whether
      there was any link between which species the ducks resembled
      physically and which they resembled in behaviour. The scale for
      the physical appearance ranged from 0 (identical in appearance to
      a mallard) to 20 (identical to a pintail). The behavioural traits
      of the ducks were on a scale from 0 to 15 with lower numbers
      indicating closer to mallard-like in behaviour.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``plumage``

         individual ducks.

      ``behaviour``
         The index of behavioural characteristics of the ducks.
