   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Proschan (1963) reported on the times between failures of the
   air-conditioning equipment in 10 Boeing 720 aircraft. The
   ``aircondit`` data frame contains the intervals for the ninth
   aircraft while ``aircondit7`` contains those for the seventh
   aircraft.

   Both data frames have just one column. Note that the data have been
   sorted into increasing order.
