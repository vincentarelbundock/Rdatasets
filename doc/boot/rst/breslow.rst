      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``breslow`` data frame has 10 rows and 5 columns.

      In 1961 Doll and Hill sent out a questionnaire to all men on the
      British Medical Register enquiring about their smoking habits.
      Almost 70% of such men replied. Death certificates were obtained
      for medical practitioners and causes of death were assigned on the
      basis of these certificates. The ``breslow`` data set contains the
      person-years of observations and deaths from coronary artery
      disease accumulated during the first ten years of the study.
