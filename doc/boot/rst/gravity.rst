         :name: description

      The ``gravity`` data frame has 81 rows and 2 columns.

      The ``grav`` data set has 26 rows and 2 columns.

      Between May 1934 and July 1935, the National Bureau of Standards
      in Washington D.C. conducted a series of experiments to estimate
      the acceleration due to gravity, *g*, at Washington. Each
      experiment produced a number of replicate estimates of *g* using
      the same methodology. Although the basic method remained the same
      for all experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were
      changes in configuration.

      The ``gravity`` data frame contains the data from all eight
      experiments. The ``grav`` data frame contains the data from the
      experiments 7 and 8. The data are expressed as deviations from
      980.000 in centimetres per second squared.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``g``
         The deviation of the estimate from 980.000 centimetres per
         second squared.

      ``series``
         A factor describing from which experiment the estimate was
         derived.
