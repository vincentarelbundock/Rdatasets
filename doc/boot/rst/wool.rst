      :name: description

   ``wool`` is a time series of class ``"ts"`` and contains 309
   observations.

   Each week that the market is open the Australian Wool Corporation set
   a floor price which determines their policy on intervention and is
   therefore a reflection of the overall price of wool for the week in
   question. Actual prices paid can vary considerably about the floor
   price. The series here is the log of the ratio between the price for
   fine grade wool and the floor price, each market week between July
   1976 and Jun 1984.
