      ``wool`` is a time series of class ``"ts"`` and contains 309
      observations.

      Each week that the market is open the Australian Wool Corporation
      set a floor price which determines their policy on intervention
      and is therefore a reflection of the overall price of wool for the
      week in question. Actual prices paid can vary considerably about
      the floor price. The series here is the log of the ratio between
      the price for fine grade wool and the floor price, each market
      week between July 1976 and Jun 1984.
