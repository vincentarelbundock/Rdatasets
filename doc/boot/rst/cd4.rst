         :name: cd4-counts-for-hiv-positive-patients

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``cd4`` data frame has 20 rows and 2 columns.

      CD4 cells are carried in the blood as part of the human immune
      system. One of the effects of the HIV virus is that these cells
      die. The count of CD4 cells is used in determining the onset of
      full-blown AIDS in a patient. In this study of the effectiveness
      of a new anti-viral drug on HIV, 20 HIV-positive patients had
      their CD4 counts recorded and then were put on a course of
      treatment with this drug. After using the drug for one year, their
      CD4 counts were again recorded. The aim of the experiment was to
      show that patients taking the drug had increased CD4 counts which
      is not generally seen in HIV-positive patients.
