         :name: sugar-cane-disease-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``cane`` data frame has 180 rows and 5 columns. The data frame
      represents a randomized block design with 45 varieties of
      sugar-cane and 4 blocks.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``n``
         The total number of shoots in each plot.

      ``r``
         The number of diseased shoots.

      ``x``
         The number of pieces of the stems, out of 50, planted in each
         plot.

      ``var``
         A factor indicating the variety of sugar-cane in each plot.

      ``block``
         A factor for the blocks.

      The aim of the experiment was to classify the varieties into
      resistant, intermediate and susceptible to a disease called "coal
      of sugar-cane" (carvao da cana-de-acucar). This is a disease that
      is common in sugar-cane plantations in certain areas of Brazil.

      For each plot, fifty pieces of sugar-cane stem were put in a
      solution containing the disease agent and then some were planted
      in the plot. After a fixed period of time, the total number of
      shoots and the number of diseased shoots were recorded.
