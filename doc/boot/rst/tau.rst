      .. rubric:: Tau Particle Decay Modes
         :name: tau-particle-decay-modes

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``tau`` data frame has 60 rows and 2 columns.

      The tau particle is a heavy electron-like particle discovered in
      the 1970's by Martin Perl at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
      Center. Soon after its production the tau particle decays into
      various collections of more stable particles. About 86% of the
      time the decay involves just one charged particle. This rate has
      been measured independently 13 times.

      The one-charged-particle event is made up of four major modes of
      decay as well as a collection of other events. The four main types
      of decay are denoted rho, pi, e and mu. These rates have been
      measured independently 6, 7, 14 and 19 times respectively. Due to
      physical constraints each experiment can only estimate the
      composite one-charged-particle decay rate or the rate of one of
      the major modes of decay.

      Each experiment consists of a major research project involving
      many years work. One of the goals of the experiments was to
      estimate the rate of decay due to events other than the four main
      modes of decay. These are uncertain events and so cannot
      themselves be observed directly.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``rate``
         The decay rate expressed as a percentage.

      ``decay``
         The type of decay measured in the experiment. It is a factor
         with levels ``1``, ``rho``, ``pi``, ``e`` and ``mu``.
