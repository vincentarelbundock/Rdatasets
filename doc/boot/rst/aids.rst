      .. rubric:: Delay in AIDS Reporting in England and Wales
         :name: delay-in-aids-reporting-in-england-and-wales

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``aids`` data frame has 570 rows and 6 columns.

      Although all cases of AIDS in England and Wales must be reported
      to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, there is often a
      considerable delay between the time of diagnosis and the time that
      it is reported. In estimating the prevalence of AIDS, account must
      be taken of the unknown number of cases which have been diagnosed
      but not reported. The data set here records the reported cases of
      AIDS diagnosed from July 1983 and until the end of 1992. The data
      are cross-classified by the date of diagnosis and the time delay
      in the reporting of the cases.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``year``
         The year of the diagnosis.

      ``quarter``
         The quarter of the year in which diagnosis was made.

      ``delay``
         The time delay (in months) between diagnosis and reporting. 0
         means that the case was reported within one month. Longer
         delays are grouped in 3 month intervals and the value of
         ``delay`` is the midpoint of the interval (therefore a value of
         ``2`` indicates that reporting was delayed for between 1 and 3
         months).

      ``dud``
         An indicator of censoring. These are categories for which full
         information is not yet available and the number recorded is a
         lower bound only.

      ``time``
         The time interval of the diagnosis. That is the number of
         quarters from July 1983 until the end of the quarter in which
         these cases were diagnosed.

      ``y``
         The number of AIDS cases reported.
