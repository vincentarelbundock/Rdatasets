         :name: description

      Proschan (1963) reported on the times between failures of the
      air-conditioning equipment in 10 Boeing 720 aircraft. The
      ``aircondit`` data frame contains the intervals for the ninth
      aircraft while ``aircondit7`` contains those for the seventh
      aircraft.

      Both data frames have just one column. Note that the data have
      been sorted into increasing order.
