      .. rubric:: Failure Time of PET Film
         :name: failure-time-of-pet-film

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``hirose`` data frame has 44 rows and 3 columns.

      PET film is used in electrical insulation. In this accelerated
      life test the failure times for 44 samples in gas insulated
      transformers. 4 different voltage levels were used.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``volt``
         The voltage (in kV).

      ``time``
         The failure or censoring time in hours.

      ``cens``
         The censoring indicator; ``1`` means right-censored data.
