         :name: description

      The ``nuclear`` data frame has 32 rows and 11 columns.

      The data relate to the construction of 32 light water reactor
      (LWR) plants constructed in the U.S.A in the late 1960's and early
      1970's. The data was collected with the aim of predicting the cost
      of construction of further LWR plants. 6 of the power plants had
      partial turnkey guarantees and it is possible that, for these
      plants, some manufacturers' subsidies may be hidden in the quoted
      capital costs.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``cost``
         The capital cost of construction in millions of dollars
         adjusted to 1976 base.

      ``date``
         The date on which the construction permit was issued. The data
         are measured in years since January 1 1990 to the nearest
         month.

      ``t1``
         The time between application for and issue of the construction
         permit.

      ``t2``
         The time between issue of operating license and construction
         permit.

      ``cap``
         The net capacity of the power plant (MWe).

      ``pr``
         A binary variable where ``1`` indicates the prior existence of
         a LWR plant at the same site.

      ``ne``
         A binary variable where ``1`` indicates that the plant was
         constructed in the north-east region of the U.S.A.

      ``ct``
         A binary variable where ``1`` indicates the use of a cooling
         tower in the plant.

      ``bw``
         A binary variable where ``1`` indicates that the nuclear steam
         supply system was manufactured by Babcock-Wilcox.

      ``cum.n``
         The cumulative number of power plants constructed by each
         architect-engineer.

      ``pt``
         A binary variable where ``1`` indicates those plants with
         partial turnkey guarantees.
