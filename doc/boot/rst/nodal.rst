      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``nodal`` data frame has 53 rows and 7 columns.

      The treatment strategy for a patient diagnosed with cancer of the
      prostate depend highly on whether the cancer has spread to the
      surrounding lymph nodes. It is common to operate on the patient to
      get samples from the nodes which can then be analysed under a
      microscope but clearly it would be preferable if an accurate
      assessment of nodal involvement could be made without surgery.

      For a sample of 53 prostate cancer patients, a number of possible
      predictor variables were measured before surgery. The patients
      then had surgery to determine nodal involvement. It was required
      to see if nodal involvement could be accurately predicted from the
      predictor variables and which ones were most important.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``m``
         A column of ones.

      ``r``
         An indicator of nodal involvement.

      ``aged``
         The patients age dichotomized into less than 60 (``0``) and 60
         or over ``1``.

      ``stage``
         A measurement of the size and position of the tumour observed
         by palpitation with the fingers via the rectum. A value of
         ``1`` indicates a more serious case of the cancer.

      ``grade``
         Another indicator of the seriousness of the cancer, this one is
         determined by a pathology reading of a biopsy taken by needle
         before surgery. A value of ``1`` indicates a more serious case
         of the cancer.

      ``xray``
         A third measure of the seriousness of the cancer taken from an
         X-ray reading. A value of ``1`` indicates a more serious case
         of the cancer.

      ``acid``
         The level of acid phosphatase in the blood serum.
