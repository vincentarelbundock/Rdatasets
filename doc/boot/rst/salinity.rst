         :name: description

      The ``salinity`` data frame has 28 rows and 4 columns.

      Biweekly averages of the water salinity and river discharge in
      Pamlico Sound, North Carolina were recorded between the years 1972
      and 1977. The data in this set consists only of those measurements
      in March, April and May.

      This data frame contains the following columns:

      ``sal``
         The average salinity of the water over two weeks.

      ``lag``
         The average salinity of the water lagged two weeks. Since only
         spring is used, the value of ``lag`` is not always equal to the
         previous value of ``sal``.

      ``trend``
         A factor indicating in which of the 6 biweekly periods between
         March and May, the observations were taken. The levels of the
         factor are from 0 to 5 with 0 being the first two weeks in
         March.

      ``dis``
         The amount of river discharge during the two weeks for which
         ``sal`` is the average salinity.
