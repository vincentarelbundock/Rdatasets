      .. rubric:: Spatial Location of Bramble Canes

         :name: description

      The ``brambles`` data frame has 823 rows and 3 columns.

      The location of living bramble canes in a 9m square plot was
      recorded. We take 9m to be the unit of distance so that the plot
      can be thought of as a unit square. The bramble canes were also
      classified by their age.

      ``age``
