   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``brambles`` data frame has 823 rows and 3 columns.

   The location of living bramble canes in a 9m square plot was
   recorded. We take 9m to be the unit of distance so that the plot can
   be thought of as a unit square. The bramble canes were also
   classified by their age.
