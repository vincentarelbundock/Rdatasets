         :name: description

      The ``channing`` data frame has 462 rows and 5 columns.

      Channing House is a retirement centre in Palo Alto, California.
      These data were collected between the opening of the house in 1964
      until July 1, 1975. In that time 97 men and 365 women passed
      through the centre. For each of these, their age on entry and also
      on leaving or death was recorded. A large number of the
      observations were censored mainly due to the resident being alive
      on July 1, 1975 when the data was collected. Over the time of the
      study 130 women and 46 men died at Channing House. Differences
      between the survival of the sexes, taking age into account, was
      one of the primary concerns of this study.
