         :name: description

      The ``downs.bc`` data frame has 30 rows and 3 columns.

      Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra
      chromosome 21 or a part of chromosome 21 being translocated to
      another chromosome. The incidence of Down's syndrome is highly
      dependent on the mother's age and rises sharply after age 30. In
      the 1960's a large scale study of the effect of maternal age on
      the incidence of Down's syndrome was conducted at the British
      Columbia Health Surveillance Registry. These are the data which
      was collected in that study.

      Mothers were classified by age. Most groups correspond to the age
      in years but the first group comprises all mothers with ages in
      the range 15-17 and the last is those with ages 46-49. No data for
      mothers over 50 or below 15 were collected.
