<h2>Prostate Cancer Survival Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset, ProstateSurvival_df, is a data frame containing survival times for two competing causes: time from prostate cancer diagnosis to death from prostate cancer, and time from prostate cancer diagnosis to death from other causes. The data set also contains information on several risk factors. The data in this data set are simulated from detailed competing risk survival curves and counts of numbers of patients per group presented in Lu-Yao et al. (2009).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data(ProstateSurvival_df)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 14,294 observations and 5 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>grade</dt><dd><p>Cancer grade categorized into 2 levels (factor).</p>
</dd>
<dt>stage</dt><dd><p>Cancer stage categorized into 3 levels (factor).</p>
</dd>
<dt>ageGroup</dt><dd><p>Age group categorized into 4 levels (factor).</p>
</dd>
<dt>survTime</dt><dd><p>Survival time in months from prostate cancer diagnosis (integer).</p>
</dd>
<dt>status</dt><dd><p>Event status: 1 for death from prostate cancer, 2 for death from other causes, 0 for censored (integer).</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset name has been kept as 'ProstateSurvival_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem.
This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the OncoDataSets package and assists users in identifying
its specific characteristics. The suffix '_df' indicates that the dataset is a data frame. The original content has not been modified in any way.
