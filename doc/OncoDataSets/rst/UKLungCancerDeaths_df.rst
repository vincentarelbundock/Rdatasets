      This dataset, UKLungCancerDeaths_df, is a data frame containing
      the number of deaths due to lung cancer among British male
      physicians. The data is categorized by years of smoking and
      cigarette consumption and was originally used in Frome (1983) to
      analyze rates using Poisson regression models.
