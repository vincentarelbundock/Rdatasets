         :name: description

      This dataset, BloodStorageProstate_df, is a data frame containing
      data on 316 men who underwent radical prostatectomy and received a
      transfusion during or within 30 days of the surgery. The dataset
      includes demographic, baseline, and prognostic factors, as well as
      data on the time to biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, as
      indicated by prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels. The main
      exposure of interest was the red blood cell (RBC) storage duration
      group, and the outcome of interest was time to PSA cancer
      recurrence.
