      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset, AIPulmonaryNodules_df, is a data frame containing
      data from a study on the performance of an artificial intelligence
      (AI) risk stratification tool for assessing Indeterminate
      Pulmonary Nodules (IPNs) in chest CT scans. The dataset includes
      information on whether cancer was diagnosed and the AI tool's
      rating of the probability of cancer (from 0 to 100).
