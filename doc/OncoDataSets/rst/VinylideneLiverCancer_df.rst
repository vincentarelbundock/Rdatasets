      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset, VinylideneLiverCancer_df, is a data frame containing
      data from an experiment to investigate whether vinylidene fluoride
      induces liver damage. The dataset records the levels of three
      serum enzymes (SDH, SGOT, SGPT) under four different dosages of
      vinylidene fluoride. Increased serum enzyme levels are indicative
      of liver damage. Real data which are available on page 10 of
      Silvapulle and Sen (2005) and in a report prepared by Litton
      Bionetics Inc in 1984. These data were used in an experiment to
      find out whether vinylidene fluoride gives rise to liver damage.

      A data frame with 40 observations and 4 variables:

      SDH
         Serum enzyme SDH levels (integer).

      SGOT
         Serum enzyme SGOT levels (integer).

      SGPT
         Serum enzyme SGPT levels (integer).

      dose
         Dose of vinylidene fluoride administered (factor with 4
         levels).

      The dataset name has been kept as 'VinylideneLiverCancer_df' to
      avoid confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem. This
      naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
      OncoDataSets package and assists users in identifying its specific
      characteristics. The suffix '\_df' indicates that the dataset is a
      data frame. The original content has not been modified in any way.
