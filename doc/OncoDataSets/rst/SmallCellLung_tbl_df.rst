      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset, SmallCellLung_tbl_df, is a tibble containing
      information on the entry age and survival time of 121 patients
      diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) under two different
      treatment regimens. The dataset provides key insights for survival
      analysis and treatment comparisons in patients with SCLC.
