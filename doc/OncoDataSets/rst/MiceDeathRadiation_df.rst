      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This dataset, MiceDeathRadiation_df, is a data frame containing
      data on deaths of RFM male mice exposed to 300 rads of x-radiation
      at 5â€“6 weeks of age. The dataset records the causes of death,
      which include thymic lymphoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, and other
      causes. Additionally, it distinguishes between mice kept in a
      conventional environment and those in a germ-free environment.
