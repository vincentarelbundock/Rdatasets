<h2>Simulated Data from Skin Cancer Chemoprevention Trial</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset, SkinCancerChemo_df, is a data frame containing simulated data mimicking the Skin Cancer Chemoprevention Trial as used in Chiou et al. (2017). It records tumor recurrence in patients who were part of the trial, which includes information on patient demographics, prior tumors, and the treatment they received.
The dataset consists of 894 observations with 7 variables.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset name has been kept as 'SkinCancerChemo_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets in the R ecosystem.
This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the OncoDataSets package and assists users in identifying
its specific characteristics. The suffix '_df' indicates that the dataset is a data frame. The original content has not been modified in any way.
