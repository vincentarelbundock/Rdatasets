      Fine foods example data

      These data are from Amazon, who describe it as "This dataset
      consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a
      period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to
      October 2012. Reviews include product and user information,
      ratings, and a plaintext review."

      A subset of the data are contained here and are split into a
      training and test set. The training set sampled 10 products and
      retained all of their individual reviews. Since the reviews within
      these products are correlated, we recommend resampling the data
      using a leave-one-product-out approach. The test set sampled 500
      products that were not included in the training set and selected a
      single review at random for each.

      There is a column for the product, a column for the text of the
      review, and a factor column for a class variable. The outcome is
      whether the reviewer gave the product a 5-star rating or not.
