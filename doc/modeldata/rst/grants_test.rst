      .. rubric:: Grant acceptance data
         :name: grant-acceptance-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A data set related to the success or failure of academic grants.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data are discussed in Kuhn and Johnson (2013):

      "These data are from a 2011 Kaggle competition sponsored by the
      University of Melbourne where there was interest in predicting
      whether or not a grant application would be accepted. Since public
      funding of grants had decreased over time, triaging grant
      applications based on their likelihood of success could be
      important for estimating the amount of potential funding to the
      university. In addition to predicting grant success, the
      university sought to understand factors that were important in
      predicting success."

      The data ranged from 2005 and 2008 and the data spending strategy
      was driven by the date of the grant. Kuhn and Johnson (2013)
      describe:

      "The compromise taken here is to build models on the pre-2008 data
      and tune them by evaluating a random sample of 2,075 grants from
      2008. Once the optimal parameters are determined, final model is
      built using these parameters and the entire training set (i.e.,
      the data prior to 2008 and the additional 2,075 grants). A small
      holdout set of 518 grants from 2008 will be used to ensure that no
      gross methodology errors occur from repeatedly evaluating the 2008
      data during model tuning. In the text, this set of samples is
      called the 2 0 0 8 holdout set. This small set of year 2008 grants
      will be referred to as the test set and will not be evaluated
      until set of candidate models are identified."

      To emulate this, ``grants_other`` contains the training (pre-2008,
      n = 6,633) and holdout/validation data (2008, n = 1,557).
      ``grants_test`` has 518 grant samples from 2008. The object
      ``grants_2008`` is an integer vector that can be used to separate
      the modeling with the holdout/validation sets.
