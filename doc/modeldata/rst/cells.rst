         :name: description

      Hill, LaPan, Li and Haney (2007) develop models to predict which
      cells in a high content screen were well segmented. The data
      consists of 119 imaging measurements on 2019. The original
      analysis used 1009 for training and 1010 as a test set (see the
      column called ``case``).

      The outcome class is contained in a factor variable called
      ``class`` with levels "PS" for poorly segmented and "WS" for well
      segmented.

      The raw data used in the paper can be found at the Biomedcentral
      website. The version contained in ``cells`` is modified. First,
      several discrete versions of some of the predictors (with the
      suffix "Status") were removed. Second, there are several skewed
      predictors with minimum values of zero (that would benefit from
      some transformation, such as the log). A constant value of 1 was
      added to these fields: ``avg_inten_ch_2``, ``fiber_align_2_ch_3``,
      ``fiber_align_2_ch_4``, ``spot_fiber_count_ch_4`` and
      ``total_inten_ch_2``.
