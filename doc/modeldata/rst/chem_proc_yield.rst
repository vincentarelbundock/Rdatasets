         :name: description

      A data set that models yield as a function of biological material
      predictors and chemical structure predictors.

      This data set contains information about a chemical manufacturing
      process, in which the goal is to understand the relationship
      between the process and the resulting final product yield. Raw
      material in this process is put through a sequence of 27 steps to
      generate the final pharmaceutical product. The starting material
      is generated from a biological unit and has a range of quality and
      characteristics. The objective in this project was to develop a
      model to predict percent yield of the manufacturing process. The
      data set consisted of 177 samples of biological material for which
      57 characteristics were measured. Of the 57 characteristics, there
      were 12 measurements of the biological starting material, and 45
      measurements of the manufacturing process. The process variables
      included measurements such as temperature, drying time, washing
      time, and concentrations of by-products at various steps. Some of
      the process measurements can be controlled, while others are
      observed. Predictors are continuous, count, categorical; some are
      correlated, and some contain missing values. Samples are not
      independent because sets of samples come from the same batch of
      biological starting material.
