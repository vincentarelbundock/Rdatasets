      Loan data

      These data were downloaded from the Lending Club access site (see
      below) and are from the first quarter of 2016. A subset of the
      rows and variables are included here. The outcome is in the
      variable ``Class`` and is either "good" (meaning that the loan was
      fully paid back or currently on-time) or "bad" (charged off,
      defaulted, of 21-120 days late). A data dictionary can be found on
      the source website.
