         :name: description

      Fatty acid concentrations of commercial oils were measured using
      gas chromatography. The data is used to predict the type of oil.
      Note that only the known oils are in the data set. Also, the
      authors state that there are 95 samples of known oils. However, we
      count 96 in Table 1 (pgs. 33-35).
