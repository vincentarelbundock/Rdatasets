   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Fatty acid concentrations of commercial oils were measured using gas
   chromatography. The data is used to predict the type of oil. Note
   that only the known oils are in the data set. Also, the authors state
   that there are 95 samples of known oils. However, we count 96 in
   Table 1 (pgs. 33-35).
