      Chicago ridership data

         :name: details

      These data are from Kuhn and Johnson (2020) and contain an
      *abbreviated* training set for modeling the number of people (in
      thousands) who enter the Clark and Lake L station.

      The ``date`` column corresponds to the current date. The columns
      with station names (``Austin`` through ``California``) are a
      *sample* of the columns used in the original analysis (for file
      size reasons). These are 14 day lag variables (i.e.
      ``⁠date - 14 days⁠``). There are columns related to weather and
      sports team schedules.

      The station at 35th and Archer is contained in the column
      ``Archer_35th`` to make it a valid R column name.
