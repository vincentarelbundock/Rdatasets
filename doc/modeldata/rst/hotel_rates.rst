      A data set to predict the average daily rate for a hotel in Lisbon
      Portugal.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data are originally described in Antonio, de Almeida, and Nunes
      (2019). This version of the data is filtered for one hotel (the
      "Resort Hotel") and is intended as regression data set for
      predicting the average daily rate for a room. The data are
      post-2016; the 2016 data were used to have a predictor for the
      historical daily rates. See the ``hotel_rates.R`` file in the
      ``data-raw`` directory of the package to understand other filters
      used when creating this version of the data.

      The ``agent`` and ``company`` fields were changed from random
      characters to use a set of random names.

      The outcome column is ``avg_price_per_room``.
