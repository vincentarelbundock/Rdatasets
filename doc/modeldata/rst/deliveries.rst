      Food Delivery Time Data

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      These data are from a study of food delivery times (i.e., the time
      from the initial order to receiving the food) for a single
      resturant. The data contains 10,012 orders from a specific
      restaurant. The predictors include:

      -  The time, in decimal hours, of the order.

      -  The day of the week for the order.

      -  The approximate distance between the restaurant and the
         delivery location.

      -  A set of 27 predictors that count the number of distinct menu
         items in the order.

      No times are censored.
