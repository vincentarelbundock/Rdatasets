      A data set to predict a binary outcome using imaging and patient
      data.

      These data were gathered to predict patient risk for ischemic
      stroke. A historical set of patients with a range of carotid
      artery blockages were selected. The data consisted of 126
      patients, 44 of which had blockages greater than 70%. All patients
      had undergone Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) to generate a
      detailed three-dimensional visualization and characterization of
      the blockage. These images were then analyzed in order to compute
      several features related to the disease, including: percent
      stenosis, arterial wall thickness, and tissue characteristics such
      as lipid-rich necrotic core and calcification.

      The group of patients in this study also had follow-up information
      on whether or not a stroke occurred at a subsequent point in time.
      The data for each patient also included commonly collected
      clinical characteristics for risk of stroke such as whether or not
      the patient had atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and
      a history of smoking. Demographics of gender and age were included
      as well. These readily available risk factors can be thought of as
      another potentially useful predictor set that can be evaluated. In
      fact, this set of predictors should be evaluated first to assess
      their ability to predict stroke since these predictors are easy to
      collect, are acquired at patient presentation, and do not require
      an expensive imaging technique.
