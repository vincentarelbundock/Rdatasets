<h2>Fat, water and protein content of meat samples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>&quot;These data are recorded on a Tecator Infratec Food and Feed Analyzer
working in the wavelength range 850 - 1050 nm by the Near Infrared
Transmission (NIT) principle. Each sample contains finely chopped pure meat
with different moisture, fat and protein contents.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If results from these data are used in a publication we want you to mention
the instrument and company name (Tecator) in the publication.  In addition,
please send a preprint of your article to:
</p>
<p>Karin Thente, Tecator AB, Box 70, S-263 21 Hoganas, Sweden
</p>
<p>The data are available in the public domain with no responsibility from the
original data source. The data can be redistributed as long as this
permission note is attached.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;For each meat sample the data consists of a 100 channel spectrum of
absorbances and the contents of moisture (water), fat and protein.  The
absorbance is -log10 of the transmittance measured by the spectrometer. The
three contents, measured in percent, are determined by analytic chemistry.&quot;
</p>
<p>Included here are the training, monitoring and test sets.
