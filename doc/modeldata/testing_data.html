<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fine foods example data
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are from Amazon, who describe it as &quot;This dataset consists of
reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10
years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include
product and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review.&quot;
</p>
<p>A subset of the data are contained here and are split into a training and
test set. The training set sampled 10 products and retained all of their
individual reviews. Since the reviews within these products are correlated,
we recommend resampling the data using a leave-one-product-out approach. The
test set sampled 500 products that were not included in the training set
and selected a single review at random for each.
</p>
<p>There is a column for the product, a column for the text of the review, and
a factor column for a class variable. The outcome is whether the reviewer
gave the product a 5-star rating or not.
