<h2>Predicting hepatic injury from chemical information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data set to predict
when a molecule has risk associated with liver function.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This  data set was used to develop a model for predicting compounds'
probability of causing hepatic injury (i.e. liver damage). This data set
consisted of 281 unique compounds; 376 predictors were measured or computed
for each. The response was categorical (either &quot;none&quot;, &quot;mild&quot;, or &quot;severe&quot;),
and was highly unbalanced.
</p>
<p>This kind of response often occurs in pharmaceutical data because companies
steer away from creating molecules that have undesirable characteristics.
Therefore, well-behaved molecules often greatly outnumber undesirable
molecules. The predictors consisted of measurements from 184 biological
screens and 192 chemical feature predictors. The biological predictors
represent activity for each screen and take values between 0 and 10 with a
mode of 4. The chemical feature predictors represent counts of important
sub-structures as well as measures of physical properties that are thought to
be associated with hepatic injury.
