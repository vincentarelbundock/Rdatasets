<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Sea slugs, common on the coast of southern California, live on vaucherian
seaweed. The larvae from these sea slugs need to locate this type of seaweed to survive. A study
was done to try to determine whether chemicals that leach out of the seaweed attract the larvae.
Seawater was collected over a patch of this kind of seaweed at 5-minute intervals as the tide was
coming in and, presumably, mixing with the chemicals. The idea was that as more seawater came
in, the concentration of the chemicals was reduced. Each sample of water was divided into 6 parts.
Fifteen larvae were then introduced to this seawater to see what percentage metamorphosed (an indication that the
desired chemical was detected).
