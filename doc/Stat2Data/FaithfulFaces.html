<h3>Details</h3>

<p>College students were asked to look at a photograph of an opposite-sex adult face and to rate the person, on a scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high), for attractiveness. They were also asked to rate trustworthiness, faithfulness, and sexual dimorphism (i.e., how masculine a male face is and how feminine a female face is). Overall, 68 students (34 males and 34 females) rated 170 faces (88 men and 82 women).
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>This dataset is based on G. Rhodes et al. (2012), &quot;Women can judge sexual unfaithfulness from unfamiliar men's faces,&quot; Biology Letters, November 2012. All of the 68 raters were heterosexual Caucasians, as were the 170 persons who were rated. (We have deleted 3 subjects with missing values and 16 subjects who were over age 35.)
