<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A patient had been diagnosed with OCD (obsessive/compulsive disorder) and underwent a series of psychotherapy sessions.  Notes from the sessions were presented to three different experienced therapists who rated sessions with a particular OCD symptom (defense of undoing) on a 1 to 4 scale (smaller values indicating worse symptoms). If all three judges agreed on the stage of a session, that determined the category.  Otherwise, they discussed until they reached a consensus. The sessions were also grouped into six groups with I being the earliest sessions and VI being the latest.
