<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In 2016 Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination for U.S. President over Bernie Sanders. A paper was circulated that claimed to show evidence of election fraud based, among other things, on Clinton doing better in states that don't have a paper trail for votes cast in a primary election than she did in states that have a paper trail. Data is for the 31 states that held Democratic primaries in 2016.
