      Tom Shields, jury commissioner for the Franklin County Municipal
      Court in Columbus, Ohio, is responsible for making sure that the
      judges have enough potential jurors to conduct jury trials. Jury
      duty for this court is two weeks long, so Tom must bring together
      a new group of potential jurors twenty-six times a year. Random
      sampling methods are used to obtain a sample of registered voters
      in Franklin County every two weeks, and these individuals are sent
      a summons to appear for jury duty. One of the most difficult
      aspects of Tom's job is to get those registered voters who receive
      a summons to actually appear at the courthouse for jury duty. This
      dataset contains the 1998 and 2000 data for the percentages of
      individuals who reported for jury duty after receiving a summons.
      The reporting dates vary slightly from year to year, so they are
      coded sequentially from 1, the first group to report in January,
      to 26, the last group to report in December. A variety of methods
      were used after 1998 to try to increase participation rates.
