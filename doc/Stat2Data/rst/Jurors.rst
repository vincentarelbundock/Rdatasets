   Tom Shields, jury commissioner for the Franklin County Municipal
   Court in Columbus, Ohio, is responsible for making sure that the
   judges have enough potential jurors to conduct jury trials. Jury duty
   for this court is two weeks long, so Tom must bring together a new
   group of potential jurors twenty-six times a year. Random sampling
   methods are used to obtain a sample of registered voters in Franklin
   County every two weeks, and these individuals are sent a summons to
   appear for jury duty. One of the most difficult aspects of Tom's job
   is to get those registered voters who receive a summons to actually
   appear at the courthouse for jury duty. This dataset contains the
   1998 and 2000 data for the percentages of individuals who reported
   for jury duty after receiving a summons. The reporting dates vary
   slightly from year to year, so they are coded sequentially from 1,
   the first group to report in January, to 26, the last group to report
   in December. A variety of methods were used after 1998 to try to
   increase participation rates.
