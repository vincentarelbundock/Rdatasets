      Experiment comparing twins (one urban, one rural) ability to clear
      airborne radioactive particles from their lungs

         :name: format

      A dataset with 14 observations on the following 3 variables.

      =========== ==============================================
      ``Pair``    Code for the twin pair: ``A`` - ``G``
      ``Environ`` Living environment: ``Rural`` or ``Urban``
      ``Percent`` Percentage of radioactivity remaining in lungs
      \

      This dataset is from a study to compare the effect of living
      environment (rural or urban) on human lung function, where the
      researchers were able to locate seven pairs of twins with one twin
      in each pair living in the country, the other in a city. To
      measure lung function, twins inhaled an aerosol of radioactive
      Teflon particles. By measuring the level of radioactivity
      immediately and then again after an hour, the scientists could
      measure the rate of “tracheobronchial clearance." The percentage
      of radioactivity remaining in the lungs after an hour told how
      quickly subjects' lungs cleared the inhaled particles.

      This dataset was renamed as RadioactiveTwins for the second
      edition.
