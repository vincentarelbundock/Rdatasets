      A dataset with 24 observations on the following 2 variables.

      +--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``Temp``     | Code for temperature (in degrees F): ``Above65`` ``Below65`` |
      +--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``Failures`` | Number of O-ring failures                                    |
      +--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
      |              |                                                              |

      The space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff in
      1987. The subsequent investigation focused on the failure of
      O-ring seals, which allowed liquid hydrogen and oxygen to mix and
      explode. These failures might be related to temperature at the
      launch site which was near freezing (32 degrees F) on that day.
      This dataset shows the number of O-ring failures on previous
      shuttle launches, along with an indicator for whether the
      temperature was above or below 65 degrees F.
