      Iridium levels in prehistoric rock layers

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 28 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``ID``
         Sample identifier

      ``Source``
         Type of rock (``Limestone`` ``Shale``)

      ``Depth``
         Depth of the sample (in meters)

      ``Iridium``
         Iridium concentration (ppb)

      The question of interest is whether a volcanic eruption or
      asteroid strike had created a dust cloud that led to extinction of
      most dinosaurs. Rock samples taken in Gubbio, Italy were measured
      for the concentration of iridium (a rare metal which is more
      common in asteroids). The deeper the sample, the older the rocks
      are. A sudden increase in iridium at some point in time would lend
      support for the asteroid hypothesis.
