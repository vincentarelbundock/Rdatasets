   Iridium levels in prehistoric rock layers

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 28 observations on the following 4 variables.

   ``ID``
      Sample identifier

   ``Source``
      Type of rock (``Limestone`` ``Shale``)

   ``Depth``
      Depth of the sample (in meters)

   ``Iridium``
      Iridium concentration (ppb)

   The question of interest is whether a volcanic eruption or asteroid
   strike had created a dust cloud that led to extinction of most
   dinosaurs. Rock samples taken in Gubbio, Italy were measured for the
   concentration of iridium (a rare metal which is more common in
   asteroids). The deeper the sample, the older the rocks are. A sudden
   increase in iridium at some point in time would lend support for the
   asteroid hypothesis.
