         :name: effects-of-a-fungus-on-tadpoles

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Comparing intestine lengths for tadpoles with and without exposure
      to Bd fugus

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 27 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Treatment``
         Exposed to fungus (``Bd``\ =yes or ``Control``\ =no)

      ``Body``
         Length of body (in mm)

      ``GutLength``
         Length of intestine (in mm)

      ``MouthpartDamage``
         Measure of damage to the mouth (e.g. missing teeth)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Biologists wondered whether tadpoles can adjust the relative
      length of their intestines if they are exposed to a fungus called
      Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd).
