      :name: Tadpoles

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Comparing intestine lengths for tadpoles with and without exposure to
   Bd fugus

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 27 observations on the following 4 variables.

   ``Treatment``
      Exposed to fungus (``Bd``\ =yes or ``Control``\ =no)

   ``Body``
      Length of body (in mm)

   ``GutLength``
      Length of intestine (in mm)

   ``MouthpartDamage``
      Measure of damage to the mouth (e.g. missing teeth)

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Biologists wondered whether tadpoles can adjust the relative length
   of their intestines if they are exposed to a fungus called
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd).
