      In recent years many colleges have re-examined the traditional
      role the scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT's) play in
      making decisions on which students to admit. Do SAT scores really
      help predict success in college? To investigate this question a
      group of 24 introductory statistics students supplied the data in
      this dataset showing their score on the Verbal and Math portions
      of the SAT as well as their current grade point average (GPA) on a
      0.0-4.0 scale.
