   In recent years many colleges have re-examined the traditional role
   the scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT's) play in making
   decisions on which students to admit. Do SAT scores really help
   predict success in college? To investigate this question a group of
   24 introductory statistics students supplied the data in this dataset
   showing their score on the Verbal and Math portions of the SAT as
   well as their current grade point average (GPA) on a 0.0-4.0 scale.
