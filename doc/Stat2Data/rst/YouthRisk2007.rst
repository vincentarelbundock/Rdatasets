This dataset is derived from the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
System (YRBSS), which is an annual survey conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of
health-risk youth behaviors. This dataset focuses on whether or not
youths have recently (in past 30 days) ridden with a drunk driver.

This dataset renamed as YouthRisk for the second edition.
