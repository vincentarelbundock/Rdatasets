   Some geologists were interested in the water chemistry of rivers in
   upstate New York. They took water samples at three different
   locations in four rivers (Grasse, Oswegatchie, Raquette, and St.
   Regis). The sampling sites were chosen to investigate how the
   composition of the water changes as it flows from the source to the
   mouth of each river. The sampling sites were labeled as upstream,
   midstream, and downstream. This dataset contains the concentrations
   (parts per million) of a variety of elements in those water samples.
   The dataset RiverIron contains the information for iron (FE) alone,
   along with the log of the concentration.
