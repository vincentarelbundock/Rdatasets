      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Experiment to measure the effect of ultrasound on deapsorbing oil
      from sand

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 40 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Salt``
         Type of water (``1``\ =salt water or ``0``\ =distilled water)

      ``Ultra``
         Amount of time each sample was exposed to ultrasound (5 or 10
         minutes)

      ``Oil``
         Amount of oil in the sample (5ml or 10 ml)

      ``Diff``
         Difference in the amount of oil removed between the ultrasound
         run and an equivalent control run (no ultrasound) (``Diff`` =
         ``Treatment`` - ``Control``)

      This data set is the result of a science fair experiment run by a
      high school student. The basic question was whether exposing sand
      with oil in it (think oil spill) to ultrasound could help the oil
      deapsorb from it better than sand that was not exposed to
      ultrasound. There were two levels of ultrasound tested (5 minutes
      and 10 minutes) and two levels of oil (5 ml and 10 ml). There was
      also a question of whether exposure to salt water or fresh water
      made a difference so half the samples had salt water, the others
      distilled water. Each combination of factor levels was replicated
      5 times. There were also an equivalent number of control
      observations run, all factors being the same but without any
      exposure to ultrasound. Each experimental run was paired with an
      appropriate control run and the response variable is the
      difference in the amount of oil removed in the experimental run
      and the control run.

      Experiment run by Las Vegas high school student Chris Mathews for
      a science fair project in spring 2016.
