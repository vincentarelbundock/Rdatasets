      Students Jennifer Wolfson and Meredith Goulet conducted a survey
      in the spring of 1992 of Grinnell College students to ascertain
      patterns of political behavior. They took a simple random sample
      of 60 students who were U.S. citizens and conducted phone
      interviews. Using several "call backs" they obtained 59 responses.
