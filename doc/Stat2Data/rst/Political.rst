Students Jennifer Wolfson and Meredith Goulet conducted a survey in the
spring of 1992 of Grinnell College students to ascertain patterns of
political behavior. They took a simple random sample of 60 students who
were U.S. citizens and conducted phone interviews. Using several "call
backs" they obtained 59 responses.
