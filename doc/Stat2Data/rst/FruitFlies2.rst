      Results from an experiment on male fruit flies with different
      levels of sexual activity and competition from other males

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 201 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``Mated``
         Was the fly allowed mating opportunities? (``n`` or ``y``)

      ``Alone``
         Did the fly live alone? (``y``\ =yes or ``n``\ = no, lived near
         another male)

      ``Mating``
         How many mating opportunities was the fly given?

      ``Total``
         Total duration of mating time over all opportunities (in
         seconds)

      ``Size``
         Size of the thorax (in mm)

      ``Lifespan``
         Lifespan (in hours, starting at the 12th day)

      ``Activity``
         Number of times a movement detector was tripped starting in the
         12th day

      Researchers randomly assigned virgin male fruit flies to one of
      two treatments: live alone or live in an environment where they
      can sense one other male fly. Flies were randomly allocated to
      either have mating opportunities with female flies or to not have
      such opportunities. Those flies that were given mating
      opportunities were given 3, 4, or 5 opportunities to mate (Mating
      measures this number). Researchers also measured size, lifespan
      and activity levels of the fruit flies.
