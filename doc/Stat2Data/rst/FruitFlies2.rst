      :name: FruitFlies2

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Results from an experiment on male fruit flies with different levels
   of sexual activity and competition from other males

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 201 observations on the following 7 variables.

   ``Mated``
      Was the fly allowed mating opportunities? (``n`` or ``y``)

   ``Alone``
      Did the fly live alone? (``y``\ =yes or ``n``\ = no, lived near
      another male)

   ``Mating``
      How many mating opportunities was the fly given?

   ``Total``
      Total duration of mating time over all opportunities (in seconds)

   ``Size``
      Size of the thorax (in mm)

   ``Lifespan``
      Lifespan (in hours, starting at the 12th day)

   ``Activity``
      Number of times a movement detector was tripped starting in the
      12th day

   Researchers randomly assigned virgin male fruit flies to one of two
   treatments: live alone or live in an environment where they can sense
   one other male fly. Flies were randomly allocated to either have
   mating opportunities with female flies or to not have such
   opportunities. Those flies that were given mating opportunities were
   given 3, 4, or 5 opportunities to mate (Mating measures this number).
   Researchers also measured size, lifespan and activity levels of the
   fruit flies.
