         :name: format

      A data frame with 60 observations on the following 6 variables.

      ``MusicBg``
         Music playing in the background (``no`` or ``yes``)

      ``Subject``
         Code for each subject (``subj1`` through ``subj20``)

      ``Sex``
         Subject's sex (``f``\ =female or ``m``\ =male)

      ``TimeGuess``
         Subject's time estimating 45 seconds (in seconds)

      ``Music``
         Type of music (``calm``, ``control``, or ``upbeat``)

      ``Accuracy``
         Absolute value of TimeGuess minus 45

      Participants were asked to judge when 45 seconds had passed in
      silence (control), while listening to an upbeat song (Metropolis,
      by David Guetta and Nicky Romero), and while listening to a calm
      song (Bach's Das Wohltemperierte Klavier, Prelude in C Major). The
      order in which the three conditions were experienced was
      randomized for each participant. Time until subject guessed 45
      seconds had elapsed (TimeGuess) and the magnitude of the
      difference from 45 (Accuracy) were recorded.
