      Each year 64 college teams are selected for the NCAA Division I
      Men's Basketball tournament, with 16 teams placed in each of four
      regions. Within each region the teams are seeded from 1 to 16,
      with the (presumed) best team as the 1 seed and the (presumed)
      weakest team as the 16 seed; this practice of seeding teams began
      in 1979 for the NCAA tournament. Only one team from each region
      (so four teams each year) advances to the Final Four. This dataset
      has a row (case) for each team in the NCAA Division I Men's
      Basketball tournament from 1979 to 2017 along with its seed and an
      indicator for whether the team made the Final Four that year. This
      dataset is an extention of FinalFourLong (that went through 2010).
