   A patient had been diagnosed with OCD (obsessive/compulsive disorder)
   and underwent a series of psychotherapy sessions. Notes from the
   sessions were presented to three different experienced therapists who
   rated sessions with a particular OCD symptom (defense of undoing) on
   a 1 to 4 scale (smaller values indicating worse symptoms). If all
   three judges agreed on the stage of a session, that determined the
   category. Otherwise, they discussed until they reached a consensus.
   The sessions were also grouped into six groups with I being the
   earliest sessions and VI being the latest.
