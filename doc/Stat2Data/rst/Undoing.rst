      A patient had been diagnosed with OCD (obsessive/compulsive
      disorder) and underwent a series of psychotherapy sessions. Notes
      from the sessions were presented to three different experienced
      therapists who rated sessions with a particular OCD symptom
      (defense of undoing) on a 1 to 4 scale (smaller values indicating
      worse symptoms). If all three judges agreed on the stage of a
      session, that determined the category. Otherwise, they discussed
      until they reached a consensus. The sessions were also grouped
      into six groups with I being the earliest sessions and VI being
      the latest.
