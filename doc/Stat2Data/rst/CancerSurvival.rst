In the 1970's doctors wondered if giving terminal cancer patients a
supplement of ascorbate would prolong their lives. They designed an
experiment to compare cancer patients who received ascorbate to cancer
patients who did not receive the supplement. The result of that
experiment was that, in fact, ascorbate did seem to prolong the lives of
these patients. But then a second question arose. Was the effect of the
ascorbate different when different organs were affected by the cancer?
The researchers took a second look at the data. This time they
concentrated only on those patients who received the ascorbate and
divided the data up by which organ was affected by the cancer. They had
5 different organs represented among the patients (all of whom only had
one organ affected): Stomach, bronchus, colon, ovary, and breast.
