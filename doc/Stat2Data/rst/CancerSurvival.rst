      In the 1970's doctors wondered if giving terminal cancer patients
      a supplement of ascorbate would prolong their lives. They designed
      an experiment to compare cancer patients who received ascorbate to
      cancer patients who did not receive the supplement. The result of
      that experiment was that, in fact, ascorbate did seem to prolong
      the lives of these patients. But then a second question arose. Was
      the effect of the ascorbate different when different organs were
      affected by the cancer? The researchers took a second look at the
      data. This time they concentrated only on those patients who
      received the ascorbate and divided the data up by which organ was
      affected by the cancer. They had 5 different organs represented
      among the patients (all of whom only had one organ affected):
      Stomach, bronchus, colon, ovary, and breast.
