      | As young students, Dominic Kelly and his friends enjoyed
        watching ants gather on pieces of sandwiches. Later, as a
        university student, Dominic decided to study this with a more
        formal experiment. He chose three types of sandwich fillings
        (vegemite, peanut butter, and ham & pickles), four types of
        bread (multigrain, rye, white, and wholemeal), and put butter on
        some of the sandwiches.
      | To conduct the experiment he randomly chose a sandwich, broke
        off a piece, and left it on the ground near an ant hill. After
        several minutes he placed a jar over the sandwich bit and
        counted the number of ants. He repeated the process, allowing
        time for ants to return to the hill after each trial, until he
        had two samples for each combination of the three factors.
