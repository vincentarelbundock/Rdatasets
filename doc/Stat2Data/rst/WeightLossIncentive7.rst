   Researchers investigated whether financial incentives would help
   people lose weight more successfully. Some participants in the study
   were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was offered
   financial incentives for achieving weight loss goals, while others
   were assigned to a control group that did not use financial
   incentives. All participants were monitored over a four month period
   and the net weight change (Before - After in pounds) at the end of
   this period was recorded for each individual. Then the individuals
   were left alone for three months with a followup weight check at the
   seven-month mark to see whether weight losses persisted after the
   original four months of treatment. This dataset has only the
   non-missing 7-month data. The 4-month data are in
   WeightLossIncentive4 and both measurements (including missing values)
   are in WeightLossIncentive.
