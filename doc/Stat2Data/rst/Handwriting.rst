   Bradley and colleagues at Clarke University gave two identical
   surveys to a sample of 203 students (each student did the survey
   twice). Each survey contains 25 writing specimens and students were
   asked to identify whether the author is male or female. Of the 25
   specimens, 12 are written by a female, 13 by a male.
