      Bradley and colleagues at Clarke University gave two identical
      surveys to a sample of 203 students (each student did the survey
      twice). Each survey contains 25 writing specimens and students
      were asked to identify whether the author is male or female. Of
      the 25 specimens, 12 are written by a female, 13 by a male.
