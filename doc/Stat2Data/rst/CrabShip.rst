         :name: description

      Oxygen intake of crabs with different noise sources

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 34 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``Mass``
         Oxygen intake of crabs with different noise sources

      ``Oxygen``
         Rate of oxygen consumption (mu moles h^-1)

      ``Noise``
         Source of noise (``ambient`` or ``ship``)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Animals that are stressed might increase their oxygen consumption.
      Biologists measured oxygen consumption of shore crabs that were
      either exposed to 7.5 minutes of ship noise or 7.5 minutes of
      ambient harbor noise.
