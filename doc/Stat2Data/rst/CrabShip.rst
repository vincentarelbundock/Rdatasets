Crab Oxygen Intake
------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Oxygen intake of crabs with different noise sources

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 34 observations on the following 3 variables.

``Mass``
   Oxygen intake of crabs with different noise sources

``Oxygen``
   Rate of oxygen consumption (mu moles h^-1)

``Noise``
   Source of noise (``ambient`` or ``ship``)

Details
~~~~~~~

Animals that are stressed might increase their oxygen consumption.
Biologists measured oxygen consumption of shore crabs that were either
exposed to 7.5 minutes of ship noise or 7.5 minutes of ambient harbor
noise.
