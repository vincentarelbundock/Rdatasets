      Amyloid-beta and cognitive impairment for a sample of Catholic
      priests

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 57 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ``Group``
         ``mAD``\ =Alzheimer's, ``MCI``\ =mild impairment, ``NCI``\ =no
         impairment

      ``Abeta``
         Amount of Abeta from the posterior cingulate cortex (pmol/g
         tissue)

      Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a protein fragment that has been linked to
      Alzheimer's disease. Autopsies from a sample of Catholic priests
      included measurements of Abeta (pmol/g tissue from the posterior
      cingulate cortex) from three groups: subjects who had exhibited no
      cognitive impairment before death, subjects who had exhibited mild
      cognitive impairment, and subjects who had mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease.
