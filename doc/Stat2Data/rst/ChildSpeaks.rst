   These data were originally collected by L.M. Linde of UCLA but were
   first published by M.R. Mickey, O.J. Dunn, and V. Clark, "Note on the
   use of stepwise regression in detecting outliers," Computers and
   Biomedical Research, 1 (1967), pp. 105-111. The data have been used
   by several authors. We found them in David Moore's Basic Practice of
   Statistics, WH Freeman (2004)
