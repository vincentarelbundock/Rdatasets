   One hundred sixty raters (75 men and 85 women) took part in judging
   intelligence (on a 1=high to 7=low scale) based on photographs of
   students. The ratings were converted to z-scores and then put on an
   IQ scale to compare to actual measured IQ. There were photos of 80
   students, 40 men and 40 women. This data set contains data for the 40
   women.
