      A 1994 study collected data on the effects of air traffic on the
      behavior of the Pacific Brant (a small migratory goose). The data
      represent the flight response to helicopter "overflights" to see
      what the relationship between the proximity of a flight, both
      lateral and altitudinal, would be to the propensity of the Brant
      to flee the area. For this experiment, air traffic was restricted
      to helicopters because previous study had ascertained that
      helicopters created more radical flight response than other
      aircraft. The data are in FlightResponse. Each case represents a
      flock of Brant that has been observed during one overflight in the
      study. Flocks were determined observationally as contiguous
      collections of Brants, flock sizes varying from 10 to 30,000
      birds.
