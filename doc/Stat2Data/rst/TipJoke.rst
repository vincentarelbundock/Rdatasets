      Can telling a joke affect whether or not a waiter in a coffee bar
      receives a tip from a customer? A study investigated this question
      at a coffee bar at a famous resort on the west coast of France.
      The waiter randomly assigned coffee-ordering customers to one of
      three groups: When receiving the bill one group also received a
      card telling a joke, another group received a card containing an
      advertisement for a local restaurant, and a third group received
      no card at all. He recorded whether or not each customer left a
      tip.
