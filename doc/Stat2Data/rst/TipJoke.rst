   Can telling a joke affect whether or not a waiter in a coffee bar
   receives a tip from a customer? A study investigated this question at
   a coffee bar at a famous resort on the west coast of France. The
   waiter randomly assigned coffee-ordering customers to one of three
   groups: When receiving the bill one group also received a card
   telling a joke, another group received a card containing an
   advertisement for a local restaurant, and a third group received no
   card at all. He recorded whether or not each customer left a tip.
