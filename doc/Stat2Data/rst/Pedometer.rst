   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   A statistics professor regularly keeps a pedometer in his pocket. It
   records not only the number of steps taken each day, but also the
   number of steps taken at a moderate pace, the number of minutes
   walked at a moderate pace, and the number of miles total that he
   walked. He also added to the data set the day of the week, whether it
   was rainy, sunny, or cold (on sunny days he often biked, but on rainy
   or cold days he did not), and whether it was a weekday or weekend.
