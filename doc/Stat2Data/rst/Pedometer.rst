      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      A statistics professor regularly keeps a pedometer in his pocket.
      It records not only the number of steps taken each day, but also
      the number of steps taken at a moderate pace, the number of
      minutes walked at a moderate pace, and the number of miles total
      that he walked. He also added to the data set the day of the week,
      whether it was rainy, sunny, or cold (on sunny days he often
      biked, but on rainy or cold days he did not), and whether it was a
      weekday or weekend.
