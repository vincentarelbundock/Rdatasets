      Some researchers in the early 1970s set out to study whether there
      is a "full-moon" effect on emergency room admissions at a mental
      health hospital. They separated the data over 12 months into rates
      before the full moon (mean number of patients seen 4-13 days
      before the full moon), during the full moon (the number of
      patients seen on the full moon day), and after the full moon (mean
      number of patients seen 4-13 days after the full moon).
