   Some researchers in the early 1970s set out to study whether there is
   a "full-moon" effect on emergency room admissions at a mental health
   hospital. They separated the data over 12 months into rates before
   the full moon (mean number of patients seen 4-13 days before the full
   moon), during the full moon (the number of patients seen on the full
   moon day), and after the full moon (mean number of patients seen 4-13
   days after the full moon).
