Some researchers in the early 1970s set out to study whether there is a
"full-moon" effect on emergency room admissions at a mental health
hospital. They separated the data over 12 months into rates before the
full moon (mean number of patients seen 4-13 days before the full moon),
during the full moon (the number of patients seen on the full moon day),
and after the full moon (mean number of patients seen 4-13 days after
the full moon).
