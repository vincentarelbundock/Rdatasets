   Twenty-two female subjects were allocated randomly to one of two
   treatment sequences in a two period crossover design. The two
   treatments were a new Drug D or placebo, both given concomitantly
   with a standard oral contraceptive which was given in both study
   periods. The oral contraceptive has two components, ethinyl estradiol
   (EE) and norethindrone (NET). The purpose of the study was to
   evaluate whether the presence of Drug D affected the bioavailability
   of each of the oral contraceptive components. Note that our dataset
   does not include the NET variable.
