      Twenty-two female subjects were allocated randomly to one of two
      treatment sequences in a two period crossover design. The two
      treatments were a new Drug D or placebo, both given concomitantly
      with a standard oral contraceptive which was given in both study
      periods. The oral contraceptive has two components, ethinyl
      estradiol (EE) and norethindrone (NET). The purpose of the study
      was to evaluate whether the presence of Drug D affected the
      bioavailability of each of the oral contraceptive components. Note
      that our dataset does not include the NET variable.
