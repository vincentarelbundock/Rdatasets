      Hanley and Shapiro (1994) report on a study conducted by Partridge
      and Farquhar (1981) about the sexual behavior of fruit flies. It
      was already known that increased reproduction leads to shorter
      life spans for female fruit flies. But the question remained
      whether an increase in sexual activity would also reduce the life
      spans of male fruit flies. The researchers designed an experiment
      to answer this question. They had a total of 125 male fruit flies
      to use and they randomly assigned each of the 125 to one of the
      following five groups.
