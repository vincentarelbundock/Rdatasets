      Comparing meniscus repair methods on cadaver knees

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 18 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Method``
         Meniscus repair method (``1`` = Vertical Suture, ``2`` =
         Meniscus Arrow, ``3`` = FasT-Fix)

      ``FailureLoad``
         Load at failure (in Newtons)

      ``Displacement``
         Displacement (in mm)

      ``Stiffness``
         Stiffness (Newtons/mm)

      Eighteen, lightly embalmed, cadaveric knee specimens were used in
      a study to compare three different methods of meniscus repair. The
      specimens were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments:
      vertical suture, meniscus arrow, FasT-Fix. They were evaluated on
      three different response variables: load at failure, stiffness,
      and displacement.
