      Since 1991, David Arseneault, men's basketball coach of Grinnell
      College, has developed a unique, fast-paced style of basketball
      that he calls "the system." This dataset comes from the 147 games
      the Grinnell team played within its athletics conference between
      the 1997-98 season through the 2005-06 season.
