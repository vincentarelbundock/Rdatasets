      Two students, Lara and Lisa, conducted an experiment to compare
      Orville Redenbacher's Light Butter Flavor vs. Seaway microwave
      popcorn. They made 12 batches of popcorn, 6 of each type, cooking
      each batch for four minutes. They noted that the microwave oven
      seemed to get warmer as they went along so they kept track of six
      trials and randomly chose which brand would go first for each
      trial. For a response variable they counted the number of unpopped
      kernels and then adjusted the count for Seaway for having more
      ounces per bag of popcorn (3.5 vs 3.0).
