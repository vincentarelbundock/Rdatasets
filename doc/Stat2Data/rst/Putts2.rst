         :name: details

      A statistician golfer kept careful records of every putt he
      attempted when playing golf, recording the length of the putt and
      whether or not he was successful in making the putt. For each
      different length, this dataset records the number of putts made,
      missed, and the total number of attempts from that length. A
      similar dataset, Putts1, has one case for each of the 587
      attempted putts, showing the length and outcome.
