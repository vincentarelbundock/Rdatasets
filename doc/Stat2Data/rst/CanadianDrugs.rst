      January 2017 vote in the U.S. Senate related to repeal part of
      ObamaCare. The "Klobuchar amendment" to a bill was introduced with
      the purpose of lowering drug prices by allowing prescription drugs
      to be imported from Canada.

      The data exclude two senators who did not vote on the amendment
      and four senators who were new to Congress and thus had received
      no money from the drug industry. The remaining 94 senators
      represent 49 states (every state except California) and each of
      these senators had received at least $3,000.
