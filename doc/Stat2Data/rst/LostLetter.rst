   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   In 1999 Grinnell College students Laurelin Muir and Adam Gratch
   conducted an experiment for an introductory statistics class. They
   intentionally "lost" 140 letters in either the city of Des Moines,
   the town of Grinnell, or on the Grinnell College campus. Half of each
   sample were addressed to Friends of the Confederacy and the other
   half to Iowa Peaceworks. The students kept track of which letters
   were eventually returned.
