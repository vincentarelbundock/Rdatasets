         :name: details

      In 1999 Grinnell College students Laurelin Muir and Adam Gratch
      conducted an experiment for an introductory statistics class. They
      intentionally "lost" 140 letters in either the city of Des Moines,
      the town of Grinnell, or on the Grinnell College campus. Half of
      each sample were addressed to Friends of the Confederacy and the
      other half to Iowa Peaceworks. The students kept track of which
      letters were eventually returned.
