      The purpose of this study was to see whether daily calcium
      supplements can lower blood pressure. The subjects were 21 men;
      each was randomly assigned either to a treatment group or to a
      control group. Those in the treatment group took a daily pill
      containing calcium. Those in the control group took a daily pill
      with no active ingredients. Each subject's blood pressure was
      measured at the beginning of the 12-week study, and again at the
      end. The decrease in blood pressure (begin-end) was recorded (so a
      negative value means blood pressure increased).
