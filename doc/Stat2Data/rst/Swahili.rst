      Hamisi Babusa, a Kenyan scholar, administered a survey to 480
      students from Pwani and Nairobi provinces about their attitudes
      towards the Swahili language. In addition, the students took an
      exam on Swahili. From each province, the students were from 6
      schools (3 girls schools and 3 boys schools) with 40 students
      sampled at each school, so half of the students from each province
      were males and the other half females. The survey instrument
      contained 40 statements about attitudes towards Swahili and
      students rated their level of agreement to each. Of these
      questions, 30 were positive questions and the remaining 10 were
      negative questions. On an individual question the most positive
      response would be assigned a value of 5 while the most negative
      response would be assigned a value of 1. By summing (adding) the
      responses to each question, we can find an overall Attitude Score
      for each student. The highest possible score would be 200 (an
      individual who gave the most positive possible response to every
      question). The lowest possible score would be 40 (an individual
      who gave the most negative response to every question).
