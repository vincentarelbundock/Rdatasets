Hamisi Babusa, a Kenyan scholar, administered a survey to 480 students
from Pwani and Nairobi provinces about their attitudes towards the
Swahili language. In addition, the students took an exam on Swahili.
From each province, the students were from 6 schools (3 girls schools
and 3 boys schools) with 40 students sampled at each school, so half of
the students from each province were males and the other half females.
The survey instrument contained 40 statements about attitudes towards
Swahili and students rated their level of agreement to each. Of these
questions, 30 were positive questions and the remaining 10 were negative
questions. On an individual question the most positive response would be
assigned a value of 5 while the most negative response would be assigned
a value of 1. By summing (adding) the responses to each question, we can
find an overall Attitude Score for each student. The highest possible
score would be 200 (an individual who gave the most positive possible
response to every question). The lowest possible score would be 40 (an
individual who gave the most negative response to every question).
