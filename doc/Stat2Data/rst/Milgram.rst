      | One of the most famous and most disturbing psychological studies
        of the twentieth century took place in the laboratory of Stanley
        Milgram at Yale University. Milgram's subjects were asked to
        monitor the answers of a "learner" and to push a button to
        deliver shocks whenever the learner gave a wrong answer. The
        more wrong answers, the more powerful the shock. Even Milgram
        himself was surprised by the results: Every one of his subjects
        ended up delivering what they thought was a dangerous 300-volt
        shock to a slow "learner" as punishment for repeated wrong
        answers.

      | Even though the "shocks" were not real and the "learner" was in
        on the secret, the results triggered a hot debate about ethics
        and experiments with human subjects. To study attitudes on this
        issue, Harvard graduate student Maryann de Mateo conducted a
        randomized comparative experiment. Her subjects were 37 high
        school teachers who did not know about the Milgram study. Using
        chance, Maryann assigned each teacher to one of three treatment
        groups:

      | Group 1: Actual results. Each subject in this group read a
        description of Milgram's study, including the actual results
        that every subject delivered the highest possible "shock."

      | Group 2: Many complied. Each subject read the same description
        given to the subjects in Group 1, except that the actual results
        were replaced by fake results, that many but not all subjects
        complied.

      | Group 3. Most refused. For subjects in this group, the fake
        results said that most subjects refused to comply.

      After reading the description, each subject was asked to rate the
      study according to how ethical they thought it was, from 1 (not at
      all ethical) to 9 (completely ethical.)
