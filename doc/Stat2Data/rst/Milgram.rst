   | One of the most famous and most disturbing psychological studies of
     the twentieth century took place in the laboratory of Stanley
     Milgram at Yale University. Milgram's subjects were asked to
     monitor the answers of a "learner" and to push a button to deliver
     shocks whenever the learner gave a wrong answer. The more wrong
     answers, the more powerful the shock. Even Milgram himself was
     surprised by the results: Every one of his subjects ended up
     delivering what they thought was a dangerous 300-volt shock to a
     slow "learner" as punishment for repeated wrong answers.

   | Even though the "shocks" were not real and the "learner" was in on
     the secret, the results triggered a hot debate about ethics and
     experiments with human subjects. To study attitudes on this issue,
     Harvard graduate student Maryann de Mateo conducted a randomized
     comparative experiment. Her subjects were 37 high school teachers
     who did not know about the Milgram study. Using chance, Maryann
     assigned each teacher to one of three treatment groups:

   | Group 1: Actual results. Each subject in this group read a
     description of Milgram's study, including the actual results that
     every subject delivered the highest possible "shock."

   | Group 2: Many complied. Each subject read the same description
     given to the subjects in Group 1, except that the actual results
     were replaced by fake results, that many but not all subjects
     complied.

   | Group 3. Most refused. For subjects in this group, the fake results
     said that most subjects refused to comply.

   After reading the description, each subject was asked to rate the
   study according to how ethical they thought it was, from 1 (not at
   all ethical) to 9 (completely ethical.)
