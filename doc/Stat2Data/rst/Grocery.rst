      Grocery stores and product manufacturers are always interested in
      how well the products on the store shelves sell. An experiment was
      designed to test whether the amount of discount given on products
      affected the amount of sales of that product. There were three
      levels of discount, 5%, 10%, and 15%, and sales were held for a
      week. The total number of products sold during the week of the
      sale was recorded. The researchers also recorded the wholesale
      price of the item put on sale.
