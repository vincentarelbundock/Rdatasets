   Grocery stores and product manufacturers are always interested in how
   well the products on the store shelves sell. An experiment was
   designed to test whether the amount of discount given on products
   affected the amount of sales of that product. There were three levels
   of discount, 5%, 10%, and 15%, and sales were held for a week. The
   total number of products sold during the week of the sale was
   recorded. The researchers also recorded the wholesale price of the
   item put on sale.
