      A statistician golfer kept careful records of every putt he
      attempted when playing golf, recording the length of the putt and
      whether or not he was successful in making the putt. This dataset
      has one case for each of the 587 attempted putts. A different form
      of the same data (Putts2) accumulates counts of makes and misses
      for each putt length.
