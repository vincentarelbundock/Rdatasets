      :name: details

   A statistician golfer kept careful records of every putt he attempted
   when playing golf, recording the length of the putt and whether or
   not he was successful in making the putt. This dataset has one case
   for each of the 587 attempted putts. A different form of the same
   data (Putts2) accumulates counts of makes and misses for each putt
   length.
