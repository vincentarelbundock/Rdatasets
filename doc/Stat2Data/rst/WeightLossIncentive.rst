      | Researchers investigated whether financial incentives would help
        people lose weight more successfully. Some participants in the
        study were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was
        offered financial incentives for achieving weight loss goals,
        while others were assigned to a control group that did not use
        financial incentives. All participants were monitored over a
        four month period and the net weight change (Before - After in
        pounds) at the end of this period was recorded for each
        individual. Then the individuals were left alone for three
        months with a followup weight check at the seven-month mark to
        see whether weight losses persisted after the original four
        months of treatment.
      | The 4-month data alone (with missing values omitted) is stored
        in WeightLossIncentive4.
      | The 7-month data alone (with missing values omitted) is stored
        in WeightLossIncentive7.
