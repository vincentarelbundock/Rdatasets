      Fertility measurement for eggs from a sample of 35 lake trout

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 35 observations on the following 4 variables.

      +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``Age``   | Age of the fish (in years)                              |
      +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``PctDM`` | Percentage of the total egg material that is solid      |
      +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``Month`` | Month fish was caught: ``Sep``\ =September or           |
      |           | ``Nov``\ =November                                      |
      +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``Sept``  | Indicator with ``1``\ =September or ``0``\ =November    |
      +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
      |           |                                                         |

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Researchers collected samples of female lake trout from Lake
      Ontario in September and November of 2002 through 2004. A goal of
      the study was to investigate the fertility of fish that had been
      stocked in the lake. One measure of the viability of fish eggs is
      percent dry mass (PctDM) which reflects the energy potential
      stored in the eggs by recording the percentage of the total egg
      material that is solid. Values of the PctDM for a sample of 35
      lake trout (14 in September and 21 in November) are given in this
      dataset along with the age (in years) of the fish.
