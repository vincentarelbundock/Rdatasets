      The race for the presidency of the United States in the fall of
      2000 was very close, with the electoral votes from Florida
      determining the outcome. In the disputed final tally in Florida,
      George W. Bush won by just 537 votes over Al Gore, out of almost 6
      million votes cast. About 2.3% of the votes cast in Florida were
      awarded to other candidates. One of those other candidates was Pat
      Buchanan, who did much better in Palm Beach County than he did
      anywhere else. Palm Beach County used a unique "butterfly ballot"
      that had candidate names on either side of the page with "chads"
      to be punched in the middle. This non-standard ballot seemed to
      confuse some voters, who punched votes for Buchanan that may have
      been intended for a different candidate. This dataset shows the
      number of votes for Bush and Buchanan in each Florida county.
