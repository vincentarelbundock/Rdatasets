   The race for the presidency of the United States in the fall of 2000
   was very close, with the electoral votes from Florida determining the
   outcome. In the disputed final tally in Florida, George W. Bush won
   by just 537 votes over Al Gore, out of almost 6 million votes cast.
   About 2.3% of the votes cast in Florida were awarded to other
   candidates. One of those other candidates was Pat Buchanan, who did
   much better in Palm Beach County than he did anywhere else. Palm
   Beach County used a unique "butterfly ballot" that had candidate
   names on either side of the page with "chads" to be punched in the
   middle. This non-standard ballot seemed to confuse some voters, who
   punched votes for Buchanan that may have been intended for a
   different candidate. This dataset shows the number of votes for Bush
   and Buchanan in each Florida county.
