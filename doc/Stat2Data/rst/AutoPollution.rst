Noise Levels of Filters to Reduce Automobile Pollution
------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Measurements of noise levels for different filters to reduce pollution
levels of automobiles.

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 36 observations on the following 4 variables.

========= =============================================================
``Noise`` Noise level (decibels)
``Size``  Vehicle size: ``1``\ =small, ``2``\ =medium, or ``3``\ =large
``Type``  ``1``\ =standard filter or ``2``\ =new filter
``Side``  Side of vehicle: code1=right or ``2``\ =left
\         
========= =============================================================

Details
~~~~~~~

In a 1973 testimony before the Air and Water Pollution Subcommittee of
the Senate Public Works Committee, John McKinley, President of Texaco
discussed a new filter that had been developed to reduce pollution.
Questions were raised about the effects of this filter on other measures
of vehicle performance. The data set AutoPollution gives the results of
an experiment on 36 different cars. The cars were randomly assigned to
get either this new filter or a standard filter and the noise level for
each car was measured.
