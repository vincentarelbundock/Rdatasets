   .. rubric:: Noise Levels of Filters to Reduce Automobile Pollution
      :name: AutoPollution

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Measurements of noise levels for different filters to reduce
   pollution levels of automobiles.

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A dataset with 36 observations on the following 4 variables.

   ========= =============================================================
   ``Noise`` Noise level (decibels)
   ``Size``  Vehicle size: ``1``\ =small, ``2``\ =medium, or ``3``\ =large
   ``Type``  ``1``\ =standard filter or ``2``\ =new filter
   ``Side``  Side of vehicle: code1=right or ``2``\ =left
   \

   In a 1973 testimony before the Air and Water Pollution Subcommittee
   of the Senate Public Works Committee, John McKinley, President of
   Texaco discussed a new filter that had been developed to reduce
   pollution. Questions were raised about the effects of this filter on
   other measures of vehicle performance. The data set AutoPollution
   gives the results of an experiment on 36 different cars. The cars
   were randomly assigned to get either this new filter or a standard
   filter and the noise level for each car was measured.
