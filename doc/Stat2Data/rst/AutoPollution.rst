         :name: noise-levels-of-filters-to-reduce-automobile-pollution

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Measurements of noise levels for different filters to reduce
      pollution levels of automobiles.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A dataset with 36 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ========= =============================================================
      ``Noise`` Noise level (decibels)
      ``Size``  Vehicle size: ``1``\ =small, ``2``\ =medium, or ``3``\ =large
      ``Type``  ``1``\ =standard filter or ``2``\ =new filter
      ``Side``  Side of vehicle: code1=right or ``2``\ =left
      \         
      ========= =============================================================

      In a 1973 testimony before the Air and Water Pollution
      Subcommittee of the Senate Public Works Committee, John McKinley,
      President of Texaco discussed a new filter that had been developed
      to reduce pollution. Questions were raised about the effects of
      this filter on other measures of vehicle performance. The data set
      AutoPollution gives the results of an experiment on 36 different
      cars. The cars were randomly assigned to get either this new
      filter or a standard filter and the noise level for each car was
      measured.
