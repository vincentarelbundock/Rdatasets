Professor Seth Stephens-Davidowitz studies the level of racial animus
across different areas in America by measuring the percent of Google
search queries that include racially charged language. A measurement,
Animus, is derived from his algorithm and is scaled to be between 0 (low
racial animus) and 250 (high racial animus). The dataset includes those
values along with demographic information about each media market.
