   Professor Seth Stephens-Davidowitz studies the level of racial animus
   across different areas in America by measuring the percent of Google
   search queries that include racially charged language. A measurement,
   Animus, is derived from his algorithm and is scaled to be between 0
   (low racial animus) and 250 (high racial animus). The dataset
   includes those values along with demographic information about each
   media market.
