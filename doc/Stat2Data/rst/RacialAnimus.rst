      Professor Seth Stephens-Davidowitz studies the level of racial
      animus across different areas in America by measuring the percent
      of Google search queries that include racially charged language. A
      measurement, Animus, is derived from his algorithm and is scaled
      to be between 0 (low racial animus) and 250 (high racial animus).
      The dataset includes those values along with demographic
      information about each media market.
