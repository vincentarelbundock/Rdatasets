      Amounts of iron in water samples of four rivers

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A dataset with 12 observations on the following 4 variables.

      +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``River``   | One of four rivers: ``Grasse``, ``Oswegatchie``,      |
      |             | ``Raquette``, or ``St. Regis``                        |
      +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``Site``    | Location of the site: ``DownStream``, ``MidStream``   |
      |             | or ``Upstream``                                       |
      +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``Iron``    | Iron concentration in the water sample (parts per     |
      |             | million)                                              |
      +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
      | ``LogIron`` | Log (base 10) of iron concentration                   |
      +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
      |             |                                                       |

      Some geologists were interested in the water chemistry of rivers
      in upstate New York. They took water samples at three different
      locations in four rivers (Grasse, Oswegatchie, Raquette, and St.
      Regis). The sampling sites were chosen to investigate how the
      composition of the water changes as it flows from the source to
      the mouth of each river. The sampling sites were labeled as
      upstream, midstream, and downstream. This dataset contains the
      concentrations of iron in the samples. The dataset RiverElements
      has similar concentration data for many other elements.
