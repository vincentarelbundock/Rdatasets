   ===============================================================================
   ``River``   One of four rivers: ``Grasse``, ``Oswegatchie``, ``Raquette``, or ``St. Regis``
   ``Site``    Location of the site: ``DownStream``, ``MidStream`` or ``Upstream``
   ``Iron``    Iron concentration in the water sample (parts per million)
   ``LogIron`` Log (base 10) of iron concentration

   Some geologists were interested in the water chemistry of rivers in
   upstate New York. They took water samples at three different
   locations in four rivers (Grasse, Oswegatchie, Raquette, and St.
   Regis). The sampling sites were chosen to investigate how the
   composition of the water changes as it flows from the source to the
   mouth of each river. The sampling sites were labeled as upstream,
   midstream, and downstream. This dataset contains the concentrations
   of iron in the samples. The dataset RiverElements has similar
   concentration data for many other elements.
