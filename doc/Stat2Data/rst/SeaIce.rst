         :name: format

      A data frame with 37 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Year``
         Year (1979 - 2015)

      ``Extent``
         Extent of arctic sea ice (in million square km)

      ``Area``
         Area of arctic sea ice (in million square km)

      ``t``
         Index for year (t=1 in 1979)

      Climatologists have been measuring the amount of sea ice in both
      the Arctic and Antarctic regions for a number of years. This
      datafile gives information about the amount of sea ice in the
      arctic region as measured in September (the time when the amount
      of ice is at its least) since 1979. The basic research question is
      to see if we can use time to model the amount of sea ice.

      In fact, there are two ways to measure the amount of sea ice: Area
      and Extent. Area measures the actual amount of space taken up by
      ice. Extent measures the area inside the outer boundaries created
      by the ice. If there are areas inside the outer boundaries that
      are not ice (think about a slice of swiss cheese), then the Extent
      will be a larger number than the Area. In fact, this is almost
      always true.
