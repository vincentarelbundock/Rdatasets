      Two undergraduate students at Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo took a
      random sample of 30 textbooks from the campus bookstore in the
      fall of 2006. They recorded the price and number of pages in each
      book, in order to investigate the question of whether number of
      pages can be used to predict price.
