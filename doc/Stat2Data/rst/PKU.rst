   Dopamine levels with different amounts of phenylalanine in diets

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 20 observations on the following 4 variables.

   ``Subject``
      Initials to identify each subject

   ``Diet``
      Level of phenylalanine in diet (``Low`` or ``Normal``)

   ``DietControl``
      Ability to follow prescribed diet (``Good`` or ``Poor``)

   ``Y``
      Concentration of dopamine (micrograms per milligram of creatinine)

      :name: details

   Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an enzyme deficiency that keeps a person
   from being able to synthesize enough dopamine. The amino acid
   phenylalanine inhibits the enzyme needed to synthesize dopamine, and
   so to some extent, a diet low in phenylalanine can moderate the
   symptoms of PKU. In short, less phenylalanine in the diet should lead
   to more dopamine in the brain. The dopamine level for each patient
   was measured after a normal diet and after a week on a low
   phenylalanine diet.

   Several of the values were altered slightly in ways that would not
   change the analysis except to simplify the arithmetic.
