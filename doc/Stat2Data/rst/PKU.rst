      Dopamine levels with different amounts of phenylalanine in diets

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 20 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Subject``
         Initials to identify each subject

      ``Diet``
         Level of phenylalanine in diet (``Low`` or ``Normal``)

      ``DietControl``
         Ability to follow prescribed diet (``Good`` or ``Poor``)

      ``Y``
         Concentration of dopamine (micrograms per milligram of
         creatinine)

      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an enzyme deficiency that keeps a person
      from being able to synthesize enough dopamine. The amino acid
      phenylalanine inhibits the enzyme needed to synthesize dopamine,
      and so to some extent, a diet low in phenylalanine can moderate
      the symptoms of PKU. In short, less phenylalanine in the diet
      should lead to more dopamine in the brain. The dopamine level for
      each patient was measured after a normal diet and after a week on
      a low phenylalanine diet.

      Several of the values were altered slightly in ways that would not
      change the analysis except to simplify the arithmetic.
