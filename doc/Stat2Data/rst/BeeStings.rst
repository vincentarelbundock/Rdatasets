----------------------------------------

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 18 observations on the following 3 variables.

============= ======================
``Occasion``  Trial: I to IX
``Treatment`` ``Fresh`` or ``Stung``
``Stingers``  Number of stingers
\            
============= ======================

Details

If you are stung by a bee, does that make you more likely to get stung
again? Might bees leave behind a chemical message that tells other bees
to attack you? To test this hypothesis, scientists dangled a 4x4 array
of 16 muslin-wrapped cotton balls over a beehive. Eight of 16 balls had
been previously stung; the other eight were fresh. The response was the
total number of new stingers left behind by the bees. The process was
repeated for a total of nine trials.

Used in first edition, but not second edition.
