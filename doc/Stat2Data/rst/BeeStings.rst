      If you are stung by a bee, does that make you more likely to get
      stung again? Might bees leave behind a chemical message that tells
      other bees to attack you? To test this hypothesis, scientists
      dangled a 4x4 array of 16 muslin-wrapped cotton balls over a
      beehive. Eight of 16 balls had been previously stung; the other
      eight were fresh. The response was the total number of new
      stingers left behind by the bees. The process was repeated for a
      total of nine trials.

      Used in first edition, but not second edition.
