   If you are stung by a bee, does that make you more likely to get
   stung again? Might bees leave behind a chemical message that tells
   other bees to attack you? To test this hypothesis, scientists dangled
   a 4x4 array of 16 muslin-wrapped cotton balls over a beehive. Eight
   of 16 balls had been previously stung; the other eight were fresh.
   The response was the total number of new stingers left behind by the
   bees. The process was repeated for a total of nine trials.

   Used in first edition, but not second edition.
