Land Area and Mammal Species
----------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Land area and number of mammal species for islands in Southeast Asia

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 14 observations on the following 5 variables.

============== =====================================
``Name``       Name of the island
``Area``       Area (in sq. km)
``Species``    Number of mammal species
``logArea``    Natural logarithm (base e) of Area
``logSpecies`` Natural logarithm (base e) of Species
\             
============== =====================================

Details
~~~~~~~

This dataset shows the number of mammal species and the area for 13
islands in Southeast Asia. Biologists have speculated that the number of
species is related to the size of an island and would like to be able to
predict the number of species given the size of an island.
