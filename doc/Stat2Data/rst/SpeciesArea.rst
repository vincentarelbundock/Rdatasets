   ``Name``       Name of the island
   ``Area``       Area (in sq. km)
   ``Species``    Number of mammal species
   ``logArea``    Natural logarithm (base e) of Area
   ``logSpecies`` Natural logarithm (base e) of Species

      :name: details

   This dataset shows the number of mammal species and the area for 13
   islands in Southeast Asia. Biologists have speculated that the number
   of species is related to the size of an island and would like to be
   able to predict the number of species given the size of an island.
