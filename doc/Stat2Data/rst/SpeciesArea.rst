      A dataset with 14 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ============== =====================================
      ``Name``       Name of the island
      ``Area``       Area (in sq. km)
      ``Species``    Number of mammal species
      ``logArea``    Natural logarithm (base e) of Area
      ``logSpecies`` Natural logarithm (base e) of Species
      \              
      ============== =====================================

      This dataset shows the number of mammal species and the area for
      13 islands in Southeast Asia. Biologists have speculated that the
      number of species is related to the size of an island and would
      like to be able to predict the number of species given the size of
      an island.
