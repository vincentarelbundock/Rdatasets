      Experiment on the effects of oxygen on sugar metabolism by
      bacteria

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 16 observations on the following 3 variables.

      =========== ===========================================
      ``Sugar``   Type of sugar: ``Galactose`` or ``Glucose``
      ``O2Conc``  Oxygen concentration
      ``Ethanol`` Ethanol concentration
      \           
      =========== ===========================================

      Many biochemical reactions are slowed or prevented by the presence
      of oxygen. For example, there are two simple forms of
      fermentation, one which converts each molecule of sugar to two
      molecules of lactic acid, and a second which converts each
      molecule of sugar to one each of lactic acid, ethanol, and carbon
      dioxide. This experiment was designed to compare the inhibiting
      effect of oxygen on the metabolism of two different sugars,
      glucose and galactose, by Streptococcus bacteria. In this case
      there were four levels of oxygen that were applied to the two
      kinds of sugar.

      Renamed to SugarEthanol in second edition.
