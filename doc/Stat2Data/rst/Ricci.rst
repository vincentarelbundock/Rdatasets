      The city of New Haven, Connecticut administered exams (both
      written and oral) in November and December of 2003 to firefighters
      hoping to qualify for promotion to either Lieutenant or Captain in
      the city fire department. A final score consisting of a 60% weight
      for the written exam and a 40% weight for the oral exam was
      computed for each person who took the exam. For each person who
      took the exams, there are measurements on their race (black,
      white, or Hispanic), which position they were trying for
      (Lieutenant, Captain), scores on the oral and written exams, and
      the combined score. These data were used as part of a court case
      (Ricci v.DeStefano) dealing with racial discrimination
