   The city of New Haven, Connecticut administered exams (both written
   and oral) in November and December of 2003 to firefighters hoping to
   qualify for promotion to either Lieutenant or Captain in the city
   fire department. A final score consisting of a 60% weight for the
   written exam and a 40% weight for the oral exam was computed for each
   person who took the exam. For each person who took the exams, there
   are measurements on their race (black, white, or Hispanic), which
   position they were trying for (Lieutenant, Captain), scores on the
   oral and written exams, and the combined score. These data were used
   as part of a court case (Ricci v.DeStefano) dealing with racial
   discrimination
