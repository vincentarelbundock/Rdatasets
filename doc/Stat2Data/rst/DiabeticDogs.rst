      .. rubric:: Lactic Acid Turnover in Dogs
         :name: lactic-acid-turnover-in-dogs

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The rate of lactic acid turnover was measured by two methods for
      normal and diabetic dogs.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 20 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Dog``
         Code for individual dogs (``d1`` through ``d10``)

      ``Method``
         Tracer method to measure response (``infuse`` or ``inject``)

      ``Operation``
         Pancreas removed to make the dog diabetic? (``no`` or ``yes``)

      ``Response``
         Rate for biochemical turnover of lactic acid

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Five dogs had their pancreas removed to make them diabetic
      (Operation=yes), the other five were normal (Operation=no). The
      rate of turnover of lactic acid was measured for each dog by two
      methods, infusion and injection.
