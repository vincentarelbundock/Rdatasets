   The U.S. Energy Information Administration tracks the production and
   distribution of various types of petroleum products. The category for
   this dataset is called residual oil, which are heavier oils (often
   called No. 5. and No. 6) that remain after lighter oils (such as No.
   4 home heating oil) are distilled away in the refining process. It is
   used in steam-powered ships, power plants, and other industrial
   applications.
