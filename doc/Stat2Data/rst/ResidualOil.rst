      The U.S. Energy Information Administration tracks the production
      and distribution of various types of petroleum products. The
      category for this dataset is called residual oil, which are
      heavier oils (often called No. 5. and No. 6) that remain after
      lighter oils (such as No. 4 home heating oil) are distilled away
      in the refining process. It is used in steam-powered ships, power
      plants, and other industrial applications.
