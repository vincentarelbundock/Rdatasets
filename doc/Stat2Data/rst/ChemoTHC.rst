   An article in the New England Journal of Medicine described a study
   on the effectiveness of medications for combatting nausea in patients
   undergoing chemotherapy treatments for cancer. In the experiment, 157
   patients were divided at random into two groups. One group of 78
   patients was given a standard antinausea drug called
   prochlorperazine, while the other group of 79 patients received THC
   (the active ingredient in marijuana). Both medications were delivered
   orally and no patients were told which of the two drugs they were
   taking. The response measured was whether or not the patient
   experienced relief from nausea when undergoing chemotherapy. Dataset
   is a 2 x 2 table of counts.
