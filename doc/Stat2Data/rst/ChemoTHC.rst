      An article in the New England Journal of Medicine described a
      study on the effectiveness of medications for combatting nausea in
      patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments for cancer. In the
      experiment, 157 patients were divided at random into two groups.
      One group of 78 patients was given a standard antinausea drug
      called prochlorperazine, while the other group of 79 patients
      received THC (the active ingredient in marijuana). Both
      medications were delivered orally and no patients were told which
      of the two drugs they were taking. The response measured was
      whether or not the patient experienced relief from nausea when
      undergoing chemotherapy. Dataset is a 2 x 2 table of counts.
