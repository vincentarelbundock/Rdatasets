      A local Grinnell realtor, Matt Karjalahti, put these data together
      to see what patterns might be found, perhaps with an improvement
      in how one sells houses or buys them. He asked Grinnell College
      economists, Lee Logan and Eric Ohrn, to help with the analysis and
      we obtained the data from them.
