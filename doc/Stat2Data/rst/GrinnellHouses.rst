   A local Grinnell realtor, Matt Karjalahti, put these data together to
   see what patterns might be found, perhaps with an improvement in how
   one sells houses or buys them. He asked Grinnell College economists,
   Lee Logan and Eric Ohrn, to help with the analysis and we obtained
   the data from them.
