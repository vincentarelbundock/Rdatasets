      Each year 64 college teams are selected for the NCAA Division I
      Men's Basketball tournament, with 16 teams placed in each of four
      regions. Within each region the teams are seeded from 1 to 16,
      with the (presumed) best team as the 1 seed and the (presumed)
      weakest team as the 16 seed; this practice of seeding teams began
      in 1979 for the NCAA tournament. Only one team from each region
      (so four teams each year) advances to the Final Four. This dataset
      is the same as FinalFourLong, except the data starts in 1985 and
      we have a extra column that is an indicator for Michigan State
      teams coached by Tom Izzo.

      Updated to FinalFourIzzo17 in second edition.
