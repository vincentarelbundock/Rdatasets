      Audiologists use standard lists of 50 words to test hearing; the
      words are calibrated, using subjects with normal hearing, to make
      all 50 words on the list equally hard to hear. The goal of the
      study described here was to see how four such lists, denoted by
      L1-L4 in this dataset, compared when played at low volume with a
      noisy background. The response is the percentage of words
      identified correctly.
