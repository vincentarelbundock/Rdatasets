   Audiologists use standard lists of 50 words to test hearing; the
   words are calibrated, using subjects with normal hearing, to make all
   50 words on the list equally hard to hear. The goal of the study
   described here was to see how four such lists, denoted by L1-L4 in
   this dataset, compared when played at low volume with a noisy
   background. The response is the percentage of words identified
   correctly.
