      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Students in a Stat2 class recorded resting pulse rates (in class),
      did three "laps" walking up/down a nearby set of stairs, and then
      measured their pulse rate after the exercise. They provided
      additional information about height, weight, exercise, and smoking
      habits via a survey.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      Data compiled over several semesters from students taking a Stat2
      course.
