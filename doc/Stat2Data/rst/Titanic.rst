      The Titanic was a British luxury ocean liner that sank famously in
      the icy North Atlantic on its maiden voyage in April of 1912. Of
      the approximately 2200 passengers on board, 1500 died. The high
      death rate was blamed largely on the inadequate supply of
      lifeboats, a result of the manufacturer's claim that the ship was
      "unsinkable." A partial data set of the passenger list was
      compiled by Philip Hinde in his Encyclopedia Titanica and is given
      in this dataset.
