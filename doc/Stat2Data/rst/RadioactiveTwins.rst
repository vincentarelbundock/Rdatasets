         :name: comparing-twins-ability-to-clear-radioactive-particles

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Experiment comparing twins (one urban, one rural) ability to clear
      airborne radioactive particles from their lungs

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 30 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``TwinPair``
         Identifies the twin pairs (1 to 15)

      ``Env``
         Residential environment (``Rural`` or ``Urban``)

      ``Rate``
         Clearance rate (percentage radioactive particles remaining
         after one hour)

      To assess lung health, the scientists measured "tracheobronchial
      clearance rate," that is, in English, "How fast do your lungs get
      rid of nasty stuff?" Each subject agreed to inhale an aerosol of
      radioactive Teflon particles. A Geiger counter held to the chest
      measured the radioactivity just after inhaling, and again one hour
      later. The clearance rate was the percentage of radioactivity
      remaining â€“ the lower the better. Subjects were 15 sets of
      identical twins, each pair with one twin living in an urban
      environment and the other in a rural environment.
