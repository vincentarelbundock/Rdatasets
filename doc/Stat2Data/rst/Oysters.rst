      Comparing methods for measuring the size of oysters

         :name: format

      A data frame with 30 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``ID``
         ID number of each oyster

      ``Weight``
         Weight (in grams)

      ``Volume``
         Volume (in cubic centimeters)

      ``ThreeD``
         Measurement from a 3D system (pixels)

      ``TwoD``
         Measurement from a 2D cross-section (pixels)

      In 2001 engineers at an R&D lab Agri-Tech, Inc, in Woodstock,
      Virginia, designed a 3-D system that they hoped would improve on
      the existing 2-D system for measuring the size of oysters. The 3-D
      system used computer scanning to estimate an oyster volume,
      whereas the old 2-D system estimated a cross-sectional area. Data
      shows the result of both systems, as well as the actual weight and
      volume of each oyster used in calibration.
