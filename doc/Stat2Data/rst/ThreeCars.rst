      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Two students collected samples of Porsche, Jaguar, and BMW cars
      that were offered for sale at an internet site. In addition to
      asking price, they recorded the model year (converting to age) and
      mileage of each advertised car. The PorschePrice dataset (from the
      first edition) has only the Porsche data and the PorscheJaguar
      dataset has the data for those two models.

      This dataset has been updated (with different car models) to
      ThreeCars2017 for the second edition.
