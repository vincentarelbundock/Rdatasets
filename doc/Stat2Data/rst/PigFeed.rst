   A scientist in Iowa was interested in additives to standard pig chow
   that might increase the rate at which the pigs gained weight. Two
   factors of interest were vitamin B12 and antibiotics. To perform the
   experiment, the scientist randomly assigned 12 pigs, three to each of
   the diet combinations (Antibiotic only, B12 only, both, and neither).
