      A scientist in Iowa was interested in additives to standard pig
      chow that might increase the rate at which the pigs gained weight.
      Two factors of interest were vitamin B12 and antibiotics. To
      perform the experiment, the scientist randomly assigned 12 pigs,
      three to each of the diet combinations (Antibiotic only, B12 only,
      both, and neither).
