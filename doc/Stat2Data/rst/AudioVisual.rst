   A data frame with 72 observations on the following 4 variables.

   ``Subject``
      SubjectIDs coded ``s1`` to ``s36``

   ``ResponseTime``

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Subjects in a reaction time study were asked to press a button as
   fast as possible after being exposed to either an auditory stimulus
   (a burst of white noise) or a visual stimulus (a circle flashing on a
   computer screen). Average reaction times (ms) were recorded for
   between 10 and 20 trials for each type of stimulus for each subject.
   Data also identifies which subjects are musicians.
