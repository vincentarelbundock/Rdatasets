      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 72 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Subject``
         SubjectIDs coded ``s1`` to ``s36``

      ``ResponseTime``
         Time to respond to a stimulus (in ms)

      ``Stimulus``
         Type of stimulus (``auditory`` or ``visual``)

         ``Musician`` or ``NonMusician``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Subjects in a reaction time study were asked to press a button as
      fast as possible after being exposed to either an auditory
      stimulus (a burst of white noise) or a visual stimulus (a circle
      flashing on a computer screen). Average reaction times (ms) were
      recorded for between 10 and 20 trials for each type of stimulus
      for each subject. Data also identifies which subjects are
      musicians.
