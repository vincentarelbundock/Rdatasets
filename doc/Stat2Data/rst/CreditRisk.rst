   Researchers conducted a survey of 450 undergraduates in large
   introductory courses at either Mississippi State University or the
   University of Mississippi. There were close to 150 questions on the
   survey, but only four of these variables are included in this
   dataset. (You can consult the paper to learn how the variables beyond
   these 4 affect the analysis.) The primary interest for the
   researchers was factors relating to whether or not a student has ever
   overdrawn a checking account.
