      Researchers conducted a survey of 450 undergraduates in large
      introductory courses at either Mississippi State University or the
      University of Mississippi. There were close to 150 questions on
      the survey, but only four of these variables are included in this
      dataset. (You can consult the paper to learn how the variables
      beyond these 4 affect the analysis.) The primary interest for the
      researchers was factors relating to whether or not a student has
      ever overdrawn a checking account.
