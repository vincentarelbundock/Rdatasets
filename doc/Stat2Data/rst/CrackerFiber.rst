Details
~~~~~~~

Twelve female subjects were fed a controlled diet, with crackers before
every meal. There were four different kinds of crackers: control, bran
fiber, gum fiber, and a combination of both bran and gum fiber. Over the
course of the study, each subject ate all four kinds of crackers, one
kind at a time, for a stretch of several days. The order was randomized.
The response is the number of digested calories, measured as the
difference between calories eaten and calories passed through the
system.
