      :name: details

   Twelve female subjects were fed a controlled diet, with crackers
   before every meal. There were four different kinds of crackers:
   control, bran fiber, gum fiber, and a combination of both bran and
   gum fiber. Over the course of the study, each subject ate all four
   kinds of crackers, one kind at a time, for a stretch of several days.
   The order was randomized. The response is the number of digested
   calories, measured as the difference between calories eaten and
   calories passed through the system.
