      Twelve female subjects were fed a controlled diet, with crackers
      before every meal. There were four different kinds of crackers:
      control, bran fiber, gum fiber, and a combination of both bran and
      gum fiber. Over the course of the study, each subject ate all four
      kinds of crackers, one kind at a time, for a stretch of several
      days. The order was randomized. The response is the number of
      digested calories, measured as the difference between calories
      eaten and calories passed through the system.
