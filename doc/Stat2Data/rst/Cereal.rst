      These data were collected by Patricia Benedict, Ronald Brahler,
      and Kenneth Motz, who read the nutritional labels on the boxes, in
      an attempt to learn whether cereals high in fiber are also high in
      sugar and calories. The cereals are all of those that were sold at
      Russo Stop & Shop in University Heights, OH, in July, 1990.
