      In 2016 Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination for U.S.
      President over Bernie Sanders. A paper was circulated that claimed
      to show evidence of election fraud based, among other things, on
      Clinton doing better in states that don't have a paper trail for
      votes cast in a primary election than she did in states that have
      a paper trail. Data is for the 31 states that held Democratic
      primaries in 2016.
