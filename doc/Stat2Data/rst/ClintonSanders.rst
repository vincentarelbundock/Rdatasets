   In 2016 Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination for U.S.
   President over Bernie Sanders. A paper was circulated that claimed to
   show evidence of election fraud based, among other things, on Clinton
   doing better in states that don't have a paper trail for votes cast
   in a primary election than she did in states that have a paper trail.
   Data is for the 31 states that held Democratic primaries in 2016.
