Details
~~~~~~~

A student was interested in prices for used Porsche sports cars being
sold on the internet. He selected a random sample of 30 Porsches from
the ones being advertised at autotrader.com. For each car he recorded
the asking price, mileage, and model year (which he converted to age).

This dataset was replaced by AccordPrice for second edition.
