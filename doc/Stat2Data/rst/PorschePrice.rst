      A student was interested in prices for used Porsche sports cars
      being sold on the internet. He selected a random sample of 30
      Porsches from the ones being advertised at autotrader.com. For
      each car he recorded the asking price, mileage, and model year
      (which he converted to age).

      This dataset was replaced by AccordPrice for second edition.

      .. rubric:: Source
