   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   College students were asked to look at a photograph of an
   opposite-sex adult face and to rate the person, on a scale from 1
   (low) to 10 (high), for attractiveness. They were also asked to rate
   trustworthiness, faithfulness, and sexual dimorphism (i.e., how
   masculine a male face is and how feminine a female face is). Overall,
   68 students (34 males and 34 females) rated 170 faces (88 men and 82
   women).

   This dataset is based on G. Rhodes et al. (2012), "Women can judge
   sexual unfaithfulness from unfamiliar men's faces," Biology Letters,
   November 2012. All of the 68 raters were heterosexual Caucasians, as
   were the 170 persons who were rated. (We have deleted 3 subjects with
   missing values and 16 subjects who were over age 35.)
