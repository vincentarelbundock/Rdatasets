      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      College students were asked to look at a photograph of an
      opposite-sex adult face and to rate the person, on a scale from 1
      (low) to 10 (high), for attractiveness. They were also asked to
      rate trustworthiness, faithfulness, and sexual dimorphism (i.e.,
      how masculine a male face is and how feminine a female face is).
      Overall, 68 students (34 males and 34 females) rated 170 faces (88
      men and 82 women).

      This dataset is based on G. Rhodes et al. (2012), "Women can judge
      sexual unfaithfulness from unfamiliar men's faces," Biology
      Letters, November 2012. All of the 68 raters were heterosexual
      Caucasians, as were the 170 persons who were rated. (We have
      deleted 3 subjects with missing values and 16 subjects who were
      over age 35.)
