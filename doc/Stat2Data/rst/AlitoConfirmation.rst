      These numbers are taken from Kastellec, J.P., Lax, J.R., and
      Phillips, J. (2010), "Public Opinion and Senate Confirmation of
      Supreme Court Nominees," Journal of Politics, 72(3): 767-84. In
      this paper the authors used opinion polls and an advanced
      statistical method known as multilevel regression and
      poststratification to determine the StateOpinion levels.
