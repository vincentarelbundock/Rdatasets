   These numbers are taken from Kastellec, J.P., Lax, J.R., and
   Phillips, J. (2010), "Public Opinion and Senate Confirmation of
   Supreme Court Nominees," Journal of Politics, 72(3): 767-84. In this
   paper the authors used opinion polls and an advanced statistical
   method known as multilevel regression and poststratification to
   determine the StateOpinion levels.
