   ======== ========================================================
   ``Diet`` ``Control``, ``Fructose``, ``Glucose``, or ``Sucrose``
   ``Days`` Number of days until half the leafhoppers in a dish died

   The goal of this study was to compare the effects of four diets on
   the lifespan of small insects called potato leafhoppers. One of the
   four was a control diet: just distilled water with no nutritive
   value. Each of the other three diets had a particular sugar added to
   the distilled water, one of glucose, sucrose, or fructose.
   Leafhoppers were sorted into groups of eight and each group was put
   into one of eight lab dishes. Each of the four diets was added to two
   dishes, chosen using chance.
