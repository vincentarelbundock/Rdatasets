      A data frame with 8 observations on the following 2 variables.

      ======== ========================================================
      ``Diet`` ``Control``, ``Fructose``, ``Glucose``, or ``Sucrose``
      ``Days`` Number of days until half the leafhoppers in a dish died
      \

      The goal of this study was to compare the effects of four diets on
      the lifespan of small insects called potato leafhoppers. One of
      the four was a control diet: just distilled water with no
      nutritive value. Each of the other three diets had a particular
      sugar added to the distilled water, one of glucose, sucrose, or
      fructose. Leafhoppers were sorted into groups of eight and each
      group was put into one of eight lab dishes. Each of the four diets
      was added to two dishes, chosen using chance.
