      A medical doctor and her team of researchers collected a variety
      of data on women who were having trouble getting pregnant. A key
      method for assessing fertility is a count of antral follicles
      (LowAFC or MeanAFC) that can be performed with noninvasive
      ultrasound. Researchers are interested in how the other variables
      are related to these counts.
