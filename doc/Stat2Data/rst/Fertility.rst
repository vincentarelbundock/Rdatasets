Details
~~~~~~~

A medical doctor and her team of researchers collected a variety of data
on women who were having trouble getting pregnant. A key method for
assessing fertility is a count of antral follicles (LowAFC or MeanAFC)
that can be performed with noninvasive ultrasound. Researchers are
interested in how the other variables are related to these counts.
