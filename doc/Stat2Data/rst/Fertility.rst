   A medical doctor and her team of researchers collected a variety of
   data on women who were having trouble getting pregnant. A key method
   for assessing fertility is a count of antral follicles (LowAFC or
   MeanAFC) that can be performed with noninvasive ultrasound.
   Researchers are interested in how the other variables are related to
   these counts.
