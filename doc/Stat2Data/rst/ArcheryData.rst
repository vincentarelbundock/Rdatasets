      In 2002, Heather Tollerud, a Saint Olaf College student, undertook
      a study of the archery scores of students at the college who were
      enrolled in an archery course. Students taking the course record a
      score for each day they attend class from the first until the last
      day. Hopefully the instruction they receive helps them to improve
      their game.
