      :name: details

   In 2002, Heather Tollerud, a Saint Olaf College student, undertook a
   study of the archery scores of students at the college who were
   enrolled in an archery course. Students taking the course record a
   score for each day they attend class from the first until the last
   day. Hopefully the instruction they receive helps them to improve
   their game.
