      Researchers were interested in whether seeded clouds would produce
      more rainfall. An experiment was conducted in Tasmania between
      1964 and 1971 and rainfall amounts were measured in inches per
      rainfall period. The researchers measured the amount of rainfall
      in two target areas: East (TE) and West (TW). They also measured
      the amount of rainfall in three control locations. Clouds were
      coded as being either seeded (treatment) or unseeded (control). A
      subset (only Winter months) of these data is stored in
      CloudSeeding. All rainfall amounts are in inches.
