      In 1987 the federal government allowed the speed limit on
      interstate highways to be 65 mph in most areas. In 1995 federal
      restrictions were eliminated, so that states assumed control of
      setting speed limits on interstate highways. This data set
      compares fatality rates for years before and after the states
      assumed control for highway speed limits.
