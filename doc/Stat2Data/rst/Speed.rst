Details
~~~~~~~

In 1987 the federal government allowed the speed limit on interstate
highways to be 65 mph in most areas. In 1995 federal restrictions were
eliminated, so that states assumed control of setting speed limits on
interstate highways. This data set compares fatality rates for years
before and after the states assumed control for highway speed limits.
