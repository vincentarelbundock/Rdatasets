   In 1987 the federal government allowed the speed limit on interstate
   highways to be 65 mph in most areas. In 1995 federal restrictions
   were eliminated, so that states assumed control of setting speed
   limits on interstate highways. This data set compares fatality rates
   for years before and after the states assumed control for highway
   speed limits.
