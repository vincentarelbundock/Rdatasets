      Forty-six mountains in the Adirondacks of upstate New York are
      known as the High Peaks with elevations near or above 4000 feet
      (although modern measurements show a couple of the peaks are
      actually slightly under 4000 feet). A goal for hikers in the
      region is to become a "46er" by scaling each of these peaks. This
      dataset gives information about the hiking trails up each of these
      peaks.
