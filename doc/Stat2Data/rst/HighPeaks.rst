   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Forty-six mountains in the Adirondacks of upstate New York are known
   as the High Peaks with elevations near or above 4000 feet (although
   modern measurements show a couple of the peaks are actually slightly
   under 4000 feet). A goal for hikers in the region is to become a
   "46er" by scaling each of these peaks. This dataset gives information
   about the hiking trails up each of these peaks.
