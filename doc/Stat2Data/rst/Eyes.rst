Pupil Dilation and Sexual Orientation
-------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data from an experiment relating pupil dilation to sexual orientation.

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 106 observations on the following 4 variables.

``DilateDiff``
   Difference in pupil dilation when looking at same-sex and
   opposite-sex nude photographs

``Sex``
   ``F``\ =female or ``M``\ =male

``Gay``
   ``1``\ =gay or ``0``\ =not, based on Kinsey scale score greater than
   3

``SexMale``
   ``0``\ =female or ``1``\ =male

Details
~~~~~~~

DilateDiff is, essentially, the difference in pupil dilation when
looking at (a) same-sex nudes and (b) opposite-sex nude photographs.
More specifically, multiple measurements of pupil size were taken under
each of the two conditions, together with a third condition that
involved a neutral stimulus. Within-subject z-scores were then computed,
which led to the DilateDiff numbers used here.

The full study included 325 students. Here we are analyzing a subset of
the data that excludes White students.
