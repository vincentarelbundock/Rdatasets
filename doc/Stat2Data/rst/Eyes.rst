      :name: format

   A data frame with 106 observations on the following 4 variables.

   ``DilateDiff``
      Difference in pupil dilation when looking at same-sex and
      opposite-sex nude photographs

   ``Sex``
      ``F``\ =female or ``M``\ =male

   ``Gay``
      ``1``\ =gay or ``0``\ =not, based on Kinsey scale score greater
      than 3

   ``SexMale``
      ``0``\ =female or ``1``\ =male

   DilateDiff is, essentially, the difference in pupil dilation when
   looking at (a) same-sex nudes and (b) opposite-sex nude photographs.
   More specifically, multiple measurements of pupil size were taken
   under each of the two conditions, together with a third condition
   that involved a neutral stimulus. Within-subject z-scores were then
   computed, which led to the DilateDiff numbers used here.

   Sexual Orientation Differences in Pupil Dilation Patterns," in PLoS

   subset of the data that excludes White students.
