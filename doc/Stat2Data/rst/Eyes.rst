         :name: pupil-dilation-and-sexual-orientation

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data from an experiment relating pupil dilation to sexual
      orientation.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 106 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``DilateDiff``
         Difference in pupil dilation when looking at same-sex and
         opposite-sex nude photographs

      ``Sex``
         ``F``\ =female or ``M``\ =male

      ``Gay``
         ``1``\ =gay or ``0``\ =not, based on Kinsey scale score greater
         than 3

      ``SexMale``
         ``0``\ =female or ``1``\ =male

      DilateDiff is, essentially, the difference in pupil dilation when
      looking at (a) same-sex nudes and (b) opposite-sex nude
      photographs. More specifically, multiple measurements of pupil
      size were taken under each of the two conditions, together with a
      third condition that involved a neutral stimulus. Within-subject
      z-scores were then computed, which led to the DilateDiff numbers
      used here.

      and Sexual Orientation Differences in Pupil Dilation Patterns," in
      PLoS ONE. The full study included 325 students. Here we are
      analyzing a subset of the data that excludes White students.
