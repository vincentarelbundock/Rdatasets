      A data frame with 60 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``Gain``
         Weight gain (in grams per week)

      ``Protein``
         Level of protein (``Hi`` or ``Lo``)

      ``Source``
         Source of protein (``Beef``, ``Cereal``, or ``Pork``)

         :name: details

      Data from this experiment compared weight gain for 60 baby rats
      that were fed different diets. Half of the rats had low-protein
      diets (Lo) and the rest had high-protein (Hi). The source of
      protein was either beef, cereal, or pork.
