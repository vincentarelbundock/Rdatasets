Experiment on Word Memory
-------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Percentage of different types of words recalled

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 40 observations on the following 4 variables.

============ =============================================
``Subject``  Code to identify each subject: ``A`` to ``J``
``Abstract`` Words were abstract? ``No`` or ``Yes``
``Frequent`` Words were common? ``No`` or ``Yes``
``Percent``  Percentage of words recalled (out of 25)
\            
============ =============================================

Details
~~~~~~~

One hundred words were presented to each subject in a randomized order.
The goal of the experiment was to see whether some kinds of words were
easier to remember than others. In particular, are common words like
potato, love, diet, and magazine easier to remember than less common
words like manatee, hangnail, fillip, and apostasy? Are concrete words
like coffee, dog, kale, and tamborine easier than abstract words like
beauty, sympathy, fauna, and guile? There were 25 words each of four
kinds, obtained by crossing the two factors of interest, Abstraction
(concrete or abstract) and Frequency (common or rare).

This dataset appears in the first edition, but is not used in the second
edition.
