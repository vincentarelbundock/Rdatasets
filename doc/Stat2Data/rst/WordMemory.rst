      ``Subject``  Code to identify each subject: ``A`` to ``J``

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      One hundred words were presented to each subject in a randomized
      order. The goal of the experiment was to see whether some kinds of
      words were easier to remember than others. In particular, are
      common words like potato, love, diet, and magazine easier to
      remember than less common words like manatee, hangnail, fillip,
      and apostasy? Are concrete words like coffee, dog, kale, and
      tamborine easier than abstract words like beauty, sympathy, fauna,
      and guile? There were 25 words each of four kinds, obtained by
      crossing the two factors of interest, Abstraction (concrete or
      abstract) and Frequency (common or rare).

      This dataset appears in the first edition, but is not used in the
      second edition.
