      A data frame with 2 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``Group``
         Treatment group (``Placebo`` or ``TMS``)

      ``Yes``
         Count of number of patients that were pain-free in each group

      ``No``
         Count of number of patients that had pain in each group

      ``Trials``
         Number of patients in each group

      A study investigated whether a handheld device that sends a
      magnetic pulse into a person's head might be an effective
      treatment for migraine headaches. Researchers recruited 200
      subjects who suffered from migraines and randomly assigned them to
      receive either the TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation)
      treatment or a sham (placebo) treatment from a device that did not
      deliver any stimulation. Subjects were instructed to apply the
      device at the onset of migraine symptoms and then assess how they
      felt two hours later. This dataset is a two-way table of the
      results.

      This dataset was called TMS in the first edition.
