   A study investigated whether a handheld device that sends a magnetic
   pulse into a person's head might be an effective treatment for
   migraine headaches. Researchers recruited 200 subjects who suffered
   from migraines and randomly assigned them to receive either the TMS
   (transcranial magnetic stimulation) treatment or a sham (placebo)
   treatment from a device that did not deliver any stimulation.
   Subjects were instructed to apply the device at the onset of migraine
   symptoms and then assess how they felt two hours later. This dataset
   is a two-way table of the results.

   This dataset was called TMS in the first edition.
