Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Metamorphose rates for sea slugs exposed to different water samples

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 36 observations on the following 2 variables.

=========== ==================================================
``Time``    Minutes after tide come in
``Percent`` Proportion of 15 sea slug larvae that metamorphose
\           
=========== ==================================================

Details

Sea slugs, common on the coast of southern California, live on
vaucherian seaweed. The larvae from these sea slugs need to locate this
type of seaweed to survive. A study was done to try to determine whether
chemicals that leach out of the seaweed attract the larvae. Seawater was
collected over a patch of this kind of seaweed at 5-minute intervals as
the tide was coming in and, presumably, mixing with the chemicals. The
idea was that as more seawater came in, the concentration of the
chemicals was reduced. Each sample of water was divided into 6 parts.
Fifteen larvae were then introduced to this seawater to see what
percentage metamorphosed (an indication that the desired chemical was
detected).
