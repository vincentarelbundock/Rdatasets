      Metamorphose rates for sea slugs exposed to different water
      samples

      A dataset with 36 observations on the following 2 variables.

      =========== ==================================================
      ``Time``    Minutes after tide come in
      ``Percent`` Proportion of 15 sea slug larvae that metamorphose
      \           
      =========== ==================================================

      Sea slugs, common on the coast of southern California, live on
      vaucherian seaweed. The larvae from these sea slugs need to locate
      this type of seaweed to survive. A study was done to try to
      determine whether chemicals that leach out of the seaweed attract
      the larvae. Seawater was collected over a patch of this kind of
      seaweed at 5-minute intervals as the tide was coming in and,
      presumably, mixing with the chemicals. The idea was that as more
      seawater came in, the concentration of the chemicals was reduced.
      Each sample of water was divided into 6 parts. Fifteen larvae were
      then introduced to this seawater to see what percentage
      metamorphosed (an indication that the desired chemical was
      detected).
