   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Each year 64 college teams are selected for the NCAA Division I Men's
   Basketball tournament, with 16 teams placed in each of four regions.
   Within each region the teams are seeded from 1 to 16, with the
   (presumed) best team as the 1 seed and the (presumed) weakest team as
   the 16 seed; this practice of seeding teams began in 1979 for the
   NCAA tournament. Only one team from each region (so four teams each
   year) advances to the Final Four. This dataset has a row (case) for
   each team in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball tournament from
   1979 to 2010 along with its seed and an indicator for whether the
   team made the Final Four that year.

   Updated to FinalFourLong17 in second edition.
