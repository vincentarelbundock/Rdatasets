   ==================================================================================
   ``Computer``    ID number of the computer used to measure metabolic rate
   ``BodySize``    Size of the caterpillar (in grams)
   ``LogBodySize`` Log (base 10) of BodySize
   ``Instar``      Number from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest) indicating stage of the caterpillar's life
   ``CO2ppm``      Carbon dioxide concentration (in ppm)
   ``Mrate``       Metabolic rate
   ``LogMrate``    Log (base 10) of metabolic rate
