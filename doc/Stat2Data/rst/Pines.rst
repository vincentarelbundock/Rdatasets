      :name: details

   This dataset contains data from an experiment conducted by the
   Department of Biology at Kenyon College at a site near the campus in
   Gambier, Ohio. In April 1990, student and faculty volunteers planted
   1000 white pine (Pinus strobes) seedlings at the Brown Family
   Environmental Center. These seedlings were planted in two grids,
   distinguished by 10- and 15-foot spacings between the seedlings.
   Several variables were measured and recorded for each seedling over
   time (in 1990, 1996, and 1997).
