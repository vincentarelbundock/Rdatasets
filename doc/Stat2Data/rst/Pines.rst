      This dataset contains data from an experiment conducted by the
      Department of Biology at Kenyon College at a site near the campus
      in Gambier, Ohio. In April 1990, student and faculty volunteers
      planted 1000 white pine (Pinus strobes) seedlings at the Brown
      Family Environmental Center. These seedlings were planted in two
      grids, distinguished by 10- and 15-foot spacings between the
      seedlings. Several variables were measured and recorded for each
      seedling over time (in 1990, 1996, and 1997).
