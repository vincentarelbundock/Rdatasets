      :name: details

   Fenthion is a pesticide used against the olive fruit fly in olive
   groves. It is toxic to humans so it is important that there be no
   residue left on the fruit or in olive oil that will be consumed. One
   theory was that if there is residue of the pesticide left in the
   olive oil, it would dissipate over time. Chemists set out to test
   that theory by taking a random sample of small amounts of olive oil
   with fenthion residue and measuring the amount of fenthion in the oil
   at three different times over the year - day 0, day 281 and day 365.
