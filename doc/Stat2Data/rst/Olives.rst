      Fenthion is a pesticide used against the olive fruit fly in olive
      groves. It is toxic to humans so it is important that there be no
      residue left on the fruit or in olive oil that will be consumed.
      One theory was that if there is residue of the pesticide left in
      the olive oil, it would dissipate over time. Chemists set out to
      test that theory by taking a random sample of small amounts of
      olive oil with fenthion residue and measuring the amount of
      fenthion in the oil at three different times over the year - day
      0, day 281 and day 365.
