----------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Voltage drop over time as a capacitor discharges

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 50 observations on the following 2 variables.

=========== ================================
``Voltage`` Voltage (in volts)
``Time``    Time after charging (in seconds)
\           
=========== ================================

Details
~~~~~~~

A capacitor was charged with a nine-volt battery and then a voltmeter
recorded the voltage as the capacitor was discharged. Measurements were
taken every 0.02 seconds.
