   Experiment with a ball swirling thorough a funnel

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 120 observations on the following 3 variables.

   ``Funnel``
      Height of the funnel (inches)

   ``Tube``
      Height of the drop tube (inches)

   ``Time``
      Time (in seconds) for the ball to drop/swirl though the funnel

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Data from a class experiment to see where a steel ball was rolled
   through a plastic tube into a long plastic funnel. The angle of the
   funnel and the angle of the tube with respect to the flat table could
   be adjusted by changing the height of either (Funnel measured from
   the table, Tube measured from the top of the funnel). The ball rolls
   down the tube, then swirls around the funnel until dropping out at
   the bottom. Total trip time was measured with a stopwatch. Heights
   were adjusted after every two drops in a randomized order.

   The funnel dropping experiment was originally described in Gunter, B.
   (1993) "Through a Funnel Slowly with Ball Bearing and Insight to
   Teach Experimental Design," The American Statistician, Vol. 47. These
   data come from a class experiment based on the setup in that article.
