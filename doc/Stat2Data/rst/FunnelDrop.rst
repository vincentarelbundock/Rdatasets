      Experiment with a ball swirling thorough a funnel

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 120 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``Funnel``
         Height of the funnel (inches)

      ``Tube``
         Height of the drop tube (inches)

      ``Time``
         Time (in seconds) for the ball to drop/swirl though the funnel

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data from a class experiment to see where a steel ball was rolled
      through a plastic tube into a long plastic funnel. The angle of
      the funnel and the angle of the tube with respect to the flat
      table could be adjusted by changing the height of either (Funnel
      measured from the table, Tube measured from the top of the
      funnel). The ball rolls down the tube, then swirls around the
      funnel until dropping out at the bottom. Total trip time was
      measured with a stopwatch. Heights were adjusted after every two
      drops in a randomized order.

      The funnel dropping experiment was originally described in Gunter,
      B. (1993) "Through a Funnel Slowly with Ball Bearing and Insight
      to Teach Experimental Design," The American Statistician, Vol. 47.
      These data come from a class experiment based on the setup in that
      article.
