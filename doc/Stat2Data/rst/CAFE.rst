      The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Bill was proposed by
      Senators John McCain and John Kerry to improve the fuel economy of
      cars and light trucks sold in the United States. However a
      critical vote on an amendment in March of 2002 threatened to
      indefinitely postpone CAFE. The amendment charged the National
      Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop a new standard,
      the effect being to put on indefinite hold the McCain-Kerry bill.
      It passed by a vote of 62-38. A political question of interest is
      whether there is evidence of monetary influence on a senator's
      vote. Scott Preston, a professor of statistics at SUNY, Oswego,
      collected data on this vote which includes the vote of each
      senator (1=Yes or 0=No) and monetary contributions that each of
      the 100 senators received over his or her lifetime from the car
      manufacturers.
