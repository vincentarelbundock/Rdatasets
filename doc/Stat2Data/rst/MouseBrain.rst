      Effects of altering serotonin levels on social interactions of
      mice

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 48 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``Contacts``
         Number of social contacts the mouse had during the experiment

      ``Sex``
         ``F``\ =female or ``M``\ =male

      ``Genotype``
         ``Minus``, ``Mixed``, or ``Plus`` (see description below)

      Serotonin is a chemical that influences mood balance in humans.
      But how does it affect mice? Scientists genetically altered mice
      by "knocking out" the expression of a gene, tryptophan hydroxylase
      2 (Tph2), that regulates serotonin production. With careful
      breeding, the scientists produced three types of mice that we
      label as “Minus” for Tph2-/-, “Plus” for Tph2+/+, “Mixed” for
      Tph2+/-. The variable Genotype records Minus/Plus/Mixed. The
      variable Contacts is the number of social contacts that a mouse
      had with other mice during an experiment and the variable Sex is
      “M” for males and “F” for females.
