         :name: format

      A data frame with 80 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``Participant``
         Participant ID (``p1`` to ``p20``)

      ``Time``
         Time to move objects (seconds)

      ``Condition``
         ``non-wrinkled/dry``, ``non-wrinkled/wet``, ``wrinkled/dry``,
         or ``wrinkled/wet``

      ``Fingers``
         Status of fingers (``non`` or ``wrinkled``)

      ``Objects``
         Status of objects (``dry`` or ``wet``)

      ``WrinkledThenNon``
         Wrinkled first? (``1``\ =yes or ``1``\ =no)

      ``DryThenWet``
         Dry first? (``1``\ =yes or ``1``\ =no)

      Each of 20 participants were measured doing a "transfer task"
      several times under each of four conditions. The transfer task was
      to pick up an item with the right hand thumb and index finger,
      pass the item through a small hole and grab it with the left hand,
      and then put the item into a box that had a hole in the lid.
      Sometimes the participant's fingers were wrinkled; sometimes the
      items were sitting in water.
