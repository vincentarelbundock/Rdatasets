      ``wrinkled/wet``

   ``Fingers``
      Status of fingers (``non`` or ``wrinkled``)

   ``Objects``
      Status of objects (``dry`` or ``wet``)

   ``WrinkledThenNon``

   Each of 20 participants were measured doing a "transfer task" several
   times under each of four conditions. The transfer task was to pick up
   an item with the right hand thumb and index finger, pass the item
   through a small hole and grab it with the left hand, and then put the
   item into a box that had a hole in the lid. Sometimes the
   participant's fingers were wrinkled; sometimes the items were sitting
   in water.
