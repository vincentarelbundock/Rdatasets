   | Scientists wondered if they could get babies to walk sooner by
     prescribing a set of special exercises. Their experimental design
     included four groups of babies and the following treatments:

   | Special exercises: Parents were shown the special exercises and
     encouraged to use them with their children. They were phoned weekly
     to check on their child's progress.

   | Exercise control: These parents were not shown the special
     exercises, but they were told to make sure their babies spent at
     least 15 minutes a day exercising.

   | Weekly report: Parents in this group were not given instructions
     about exercise. Like the parents in the treatment group, however,
     they received a phone call each week to check on progress.

   Final report: These parents were not given weekly phone calls or
   instructions about exercises. They reported at the end of the study.
