      | Scientists wondered if they could get babies to walk sooner by
        prescribing a set of special exercises. Their experimental
        design included four groups of babies and the following
        treatments:

      | Special exercises: Parents were shown the special exercises and
        encouraged to use them with their children. They were phoned
        weekly to check on their child's progress.

      | Exercise control: These parents were not shown the special
        exercises, but they were told to make sure their babies spent at
        least 15 minutes a day exercising.

      | Weekly report: Parents in this group were not given instructions
        about exercise. Like the parents in the treatment group,
        however, they received a phone call each week to check on
        progress.

      Final report: These parents were not given weekly phone calls or
      instructions about exercises. They reported at the end of the
      study.
