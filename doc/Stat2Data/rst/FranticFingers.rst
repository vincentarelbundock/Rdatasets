Finger Tap Rates
----------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Finger tap rates after drug administration

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 12 observations on the following 4 variables.

``ID``
   Case ID

``Rate``
   Finger taps in a fixed time interval

``Subj``
   Subject code (``A``, ``B``, ``C``, or ``D``)

``Drug``
   Drug administered (``Ca``\ =caffeine, ``Pl``\ =placebo, or
   ``Th``\ =theobromine)

Details
~~~~~~~

Scientists Scott and Chen published research that compared the effects
of caffeine with those of theobromine (a similar chemical found in
chocolate) and with those of a placebo. Their experiment used four human
subjects and took place over several days. Each day each subject
swallowed a tablet containing one of caffeine, theobromine, or the
placebo. Two hours later they were timed while tapping a finger in a
specified manner (that they had practiced earlier, to control for
learning effects). The response is the number of taps in a fixed time
interval.
