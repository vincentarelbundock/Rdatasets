      Finger tap rates after drug administration

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 12 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``ID``
         Case ID

      ``Rate``
         Finger taps in a fixed time interval

      ``Subj``
         Subject code (``A``, ``B``, ``C``, or ``D``)

      ``Drug``
         Drug administered (``Ca``\ =caffeine, ``Pl``\ =placebo, or
         ``Th``\ =theobromine)

      Scientists Scott and Chen published research that compared the
      effects of caffeine with those of theobromine (a similar chemical
      found in chocolate) and with those of a placebo. Their experiment
      used four human subjects and took place over several days. Each
      day each subject swallowed a tablet containing one of caffeine,
      theobromine, or the placebo. Two hours later they were timed while
      tapping a finger in a specified manner (that they had practiced
      earlier, to control for learning effects). The response is the
      number of taps in a fixed time interval.
