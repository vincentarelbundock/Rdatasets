<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Scientists wondered if they could get babies to walk sooner by prescribing a set of special exercises.
Their experimental design  included four groups of babies and the following treatments:<br />
</p>
<p>Special exercises: Parents were shown the special exercises and encouraged to use them with
their children. They were phoned weekly to check on their child's progress.<br />
</p>
<p>Exercise control: These parents were not shown the special exercises, but they were told to
make sure their babies spent at least 15 minutes a day exercising. <br />
</p>
<p>Weekly report: Parents in this group were not given instructions about exercise. Like the
parents in the treatment group, however, they received a phone call each week to check on
progress.<br />
</p>
<p>Final report: These parents were not given weekly phone calls or instructions about exercises.
They reported at the end of the study.
