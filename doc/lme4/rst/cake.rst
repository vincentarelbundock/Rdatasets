      .. rubric:: Breakage Angle of Chocolate Cakes
         :name: breakage-angle-of-chocolate-cakes

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data on the breakage angle of chocolate cakes made with three
      different recipes and baked at six different temperatures. This is
      a split-plot design with the recipes being whole-units and the
      different temperatures being applied to sub-units (within
      replicates). The experimental notes suggest that the replicate
      numbering represents temporal ordering.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 270 observations on the following 5 variables.

      ``replicate``
         a factor with levels ``1`` to ``15``

      ``recipe``
         a factor with levels ``A``, ``B`` and ``C``

      ``temperature``
         an ordered factor with levels ``175`` < ``185`` < ``195`` <
         ``205`` < ``215`` < ``225``

      ``angle``
         a numeric vector giving the angle at which the cake broke.

      ``temp``
         numeric value of the baking temperature (degrees F).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The ``replicate`` factor is nested within the ``recipe`` factor,
      and ``temperature`` is nested within ``replicate``.
