      .. rubric:: Paste strength by batch and cask
         :name: paste-strength-by-batch-and-cask

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Strength of a chemical paste product; its quality depending on the
      delivery batch, and the cask within the delivery.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 60 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``strength``
         paste strength.

      ``batch``
         delivery batch from which the sample was sample. A factor with
         10 levels: ‘A’ to ‘J’.

      ``cask``
         cask within the delivery batch from which the sample was
         chosen. A factor with 3 levels: ‘a’ to ‘c’.

      ``sample``
         the sample of paste whose strength was assayed, two assays per
         sample. A factor with 30 levels: ‘A:a’ to ‘J:c’.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The data are described in Davies and Goldsmith (1972) as coming
      from “ deliveries of a chemical paste product contained in casks
      where, in addition to sampling and testing errors, there are
      variations in quality between deliveries ... As a routine, three
      casks selected at random from each delivery were sampled and the
      samples were kept for reference. ... Ten of the delivery batches
      were sampled at random and two analytical tests carried out on
      each of the 30 samples”.
