      .. rubric:: Yield of dyestuff by batch
         :name: yield-of-dyestuff-by-batch

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The ``Dyestuff`` data frame provides the yield of dyestuff
      (Naphthalene Black 12B) from 5 different preparations from each of
      6 different batchs of an intermediate product (H-acid). The
      ``Dyestuff2`` data were generated data in the same structure but
      with a large residual variance relative to the batch variance.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      Data frames, each with 30 observations on the following 2
      variables.

      ``Batch``
         a factor indicating the batch of the intermediate product from
         which the preparation was created.

      ``Yield``
         the yield of dyestuff from the preparation (grams of standard
         color).

      The ``Dyestuff`` data are described in Davies and Goldsmith (1972)
      as coming from “an investigation to find out how much the
      variation from batch to batch in the quality of an intermediate
      product (H-acid) contributes to the variation in the yield of the
      dyestuff (Naphthalene Black 12B) made from it. In the experiment
      six samples of the intermediate, representing different batches of
      works manufacture, were obtained, and five preparations of the
      dyestuff were made in the laboratory from each sample. The
      equivalent yield of each preparation as grams of standard colour
      was determined by dye-trial.”

      The ``Dyestuff2`` data are described in Box and Tiao (1973) as
      illustrating “ the case where between-batches mean square is less
      than the within-batches mean square. These data had to be
      constructed for although examples of this sort undoubtably occur
      in practice, they seem to be rarely published.”
