      .. rubric:: Reaction times in a sleep deprivation study
         :name: reaction-times-in-a-sleep-deprivation-study

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The average reaction time per day (in milliseconds) for subjects
      in a sleep deprivation study.

      Days 0-1 were adaptation and training (T1/T2), day 2 was baseline
      (B); sleep deprivation started after day 2.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 180 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``Reaction``
         Average reaction time (ms)

      ``Days``
         Number of days of sleep deprivation

      ``Subject``
         Subject number on which the observation was made.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      These data are from the study described in Belenky et al. (2003),
      for the most sleep-deprived group (3 hours time-in-bed) and for
      the first 10 days of the study, up to the recovery period. The
      original study analyzed speed (1/(reaction time)) and treated day
      as a categorical rather than a continuous predictor.
