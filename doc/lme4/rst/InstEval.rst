      .. rubric:: University Lecture/Instructor Evaluations by Students
         at ETH
         :name: university-lectureinstructor-evaluations-by-students-at-eth

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      University lecture evaluations by students at ETH Zurich,
      anonymized for privacy protection. This is an interesting “medium”
      sized example of a *partially* nested mixed effect model.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 73421 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``s``
         a factor with levels ``1:2972`` denoting individual students.

      ``d``
         a factor with 1128 levels from ``1:2160``, denoting individual
         professors or lecturers.

      ``studage``
         an ordered factor with levels ``2`` < ``4`` < ``6`` < ``8``,
         denoting student's “age” measured in the *semester* number the
         student has been enrolled.

      ``lectage``
         an ordered factor with 6 levels, ``1`` < ``2`` < ... < ``6``,
         measuring how many semesters back the lecture rated had taken
         place.

      ``service``
         a binary factor with levels ``0`` and ``1``; a lecture is a
         “service”, if held for a different department than the
         lecturer's main one.

      ``dept``
         a factor with 14 levels from ``1:15``, using a random code for
         the department of the lecture.

      ``y``
         a numeric vector of *ratings* of lectures by the students,
         using the discrete scale ``1:5``, with meanings of ‘poor’ to
         ‘very good’.

      Each observation is one student's rating for a specific lecture
      (of one lecturer, during one semester in the past).

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The main goal of the survey is to find “the best liked prof”,
      according to the lectures given. Statistical analysis of such data
      has been the basis for a (student) jury selecting the final
      winners.

      The present data set has been anonymized and slightly simplified
      on purpose.
