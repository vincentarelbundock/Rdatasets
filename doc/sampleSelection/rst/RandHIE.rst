      'The RAND Health Insurance Experiment (RAND HIE) was a
      comprehensive study of health care cost, utilization and outcome
      in the United States. It is the only randomized study of health
      insurance, and the only study which can give definitive evidence
      as to the causal effects of different health insurance plans.
      [...] Although the fieldwork of the study was conducted between
      1974 and 1982, the results are still highly relevant, since RAND
      HIE is the only study which can make causal statements.'
