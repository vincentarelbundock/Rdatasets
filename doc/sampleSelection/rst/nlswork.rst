      Two different versions of this data set are available on the
      internet. They are slighly different: The variable ``wks_work``
      (weeks worked last year) is ``101`` in this version (from Stata),
      but ``NA`` in the version provided by the Boston College for the
      observation with ``idcode = 1`` and ``year = 83``. Moreover, this
      variable is ``NA`` in this version (from Stata), but ``104`` in
      the version provided by the Boston College for the observation
      with ``idcode = 2`` and ``year = 87``.
