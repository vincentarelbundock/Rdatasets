      Plasma cells are responsible for manufacturing immunoglobulins, an
      important part of the immune defense. At any given time there are
      estimated to be about ``10^6`` different immunoglobulins in the
      circulation at any one time. When a patient has a plasma cell
      malignancy the distribution will become dominated by a single
      isotype, the product of the malignant clone, visible as a spike on
      a serum protein electrophoresis. Monoclonal gammopathy of
      undertermined significance (MGUS) is the presence of such a spike,
      but in a patient with no evidence of overt malignancy. This data
      set of 241 sequential subjects at Mayo Clinic was the
      groundbreaking study defining the natural history of such
      subjects. Due to the diligence of the principle investigator 0
      subjects have been lost to follow-up.

      Three subjects had MGUS detected on the day of death. In data set
      ``mgus1`` these subjects have the time to MGUS coded as .5 day
      before the death in order to avoid tied times.

      These data sets were updated in Jan 2015 to correct some small
      errors.
