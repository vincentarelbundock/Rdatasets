      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 181 observations on the following 4 variables.

      ``trt``
         treatment assignment: ``Control`` or ``Germ-free``

      ``days``
         days until death

      ``outcome``
         outcome: ``censor``, ``thymic     lymphoma``,
         ``reticulum cell sarcoma`` ``other causes``

      ``id``
         mouse id

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Two groups of male mice were given 300 rads of radiation and
      followed for cancer incidence. One group was maintained in a germ
      free environment. The data set is used as an example of competing
      risks in Kalbfleisch and Prentice. The germ-free environment has
      little effect on the rate of occurence of thymic lymphoma, but
      significantly delays the other causes of death.

      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      The Ontology Search website defines reticulm cell sarcoma as "An
      antiquated term that refers to a non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed of
      diffuse infiltrates of large, often anaplastic lymphocytes".

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      The data can be found in appendix I of Kalbfleisch and Prentice.
