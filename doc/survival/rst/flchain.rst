      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This is a stratified random sample containing 1/2 of the subjects
      from a study of the relationship between serum free light chain
      (FLC) and mortality. The original sample contains samples on
      approximately 2/3 of the residents of Olmsted County aged 50 or
      greater.

      A data frame with 7874 persons containing the following variables.

      ``age``
         age in years

      ``sex``
         F=female, M=male

      ``sample.yr``
         the calendar year in which a blood sample was obtained

      ``kappa``
         serum free light chain, kappa portion

      ``lambda``
         serum free light chain, lambda portion

      ``flc.grp``
         the FLC group for the subject, as used in the original analysis

      ``creatinine``
         serum creatinine

      ``mgus``
         1 if the subject had been diagnosed with monoclonal gammapothy
         (MGUS)

      ``futime``
         days from enrollment until death. Note that there are 3
         subjects whose sample was obtained on their death date.

      ``death``
         0=alive at last contact date, 1=dead

      ``chapter``
         for those who died, a grouping of their primary cause of death
         by chapter headings of the International Code of Diseases ICD-9

      In 1995 Dr. Robert Kyle embarked on a study to determine the
      prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
      (MGUS) in Olmsted County, Minnesota, a condition which is normally
      only found by chance from a test (serum electrophoresis) which is
      ordered for other causes. Later work suggested that one component
      of immunoglobulin production, the serum free light chain, might be
      a possible marker for immune disregulation. In 2010 Dr. Angela
      Dispenzieri and colleagues assayed FLC levels on those samples
      from the original study for which they had patient permission and
      from which sufficient material remained for further testing. They
      found that elevated FLC levels were indeed associated with higher
      death rates.

      Patients were recruited when they came to the clinic for other
      appointments, with a final random sample of those who had not yet
      had a visit since the study began. An interesting side question is
      whether there are differences between early, mid, and late
      recruits.

      This data set contains an age and sex stratified random sample
      that includes 7874 of the original 15759 subjects. The original
      subject identifiers and dates have been removed to protect patient
      identity. Subsampling was done to further protect this
      information.
