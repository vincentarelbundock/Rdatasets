      .. rubric:: Note
         :name: note

      The use of 1/2 for alive/dead instead of the usual 0/1 is a
      historical footnote. For data contained on punch cards, IBM 360
      Fortran treated blank as a zero, which led to a policy within the
      section of Biostatistics to never use "0" as a data value since
      one could not distinguish it from a missing value. The policy
      became a habit, as is often the case; and the 1/2 coding endured
      long beyond the demise of punch cards and Fortran.
