      .. rubric:: Liver transplant waiting list
         :name: liver-transplant-waiting-list

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Subjects on a liver transplant waiting list from 1990-1999, and
      their disposition: received a transplant, died while waiting,
      withdrew from the list, or censored.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         transplant
         data(transplant, package="survival")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 815 (transplant) observations on the following 6
      variables.

      ``age``
         age at addition to the waiting list

      ``sex``
         ``m`` or ``f``

      ``abo``
         blood type: ``A``, ``B``, ``AB`` or ``O``

      ``year``
         year in which they entered the waiting list

      ``futime``
         time from entry to final disposition

      ``event``
         final disposition: ``censored``, ``death``, ``ltx`` or
         ``withdraw``

      This represents the transplant experience in a particular region,
      over a time period in which liver transplant became much more
      widely recognized as a viable treatment modality. The number of
      liver transplants rises over the period, but the number of
      subjects added to the liver transplant waiting list grew much
      faster. Important questions addressed by the data are the change
      in waiting time, who waits, and whether there was an consequent
      increase in deaths while on the list.

      Blood type is an important consideration. Donor livers from
      subjects with blood type O can be used by patients with A, B, AB
      or 0 blood types, whereas an AB liver can only be used by an AB
      recipient. Thus type O subjects on the waiting list are at a
      disadvantage, since the pool of competitors is larger for type O
      donor livers.

      This data is of historical interest and provides a useful example
      of competing risks, but it has little relevance to current
      practice. Liver allocation policies have evolved and now depend
      directly on each individual patient's risk and need, assessments
      of which are regularly updated while a patient is on the waiting
      list. The overall organ shortage remains acute, however.

      The ``transplant`` data set was a version used early in the
      analysis, ``transplant2`` has several additions and corrections,
      and was the final data set and matches the paper.
