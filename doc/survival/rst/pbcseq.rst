      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      This data is a continuation of the PBC data set, and contains the
      follow-up laboratory data for each study patient. An analysis
      based on the data can be found in Murtagh, et. al.

      The primary PBC data set contains only baseline measurements of
      the laboratory parameters. This data set contains multiple
      laboratory results, but only on the 312 randomized patients. Some
      baseline data values in this file differ from the original PBC
      file, for instance, the data errors in prothrombin time and age
      which were discovered after the original analysis (see Fleming and
      Harrington, figure 4.6.7). It also contains further follow-up.

      One feature of the data deserves special comment. The last
      observation before death or liver transplant often has many more
      missing covariates than other data rows. The original clinical
      protocol for these patients specified visits at 6 months, 1 year,
      and annually thereafter. At these protocol visits lab values were
      obtained for a pre-specified battery of tests. "Extra" visits,
      often undertaken because of worsening medical condition, did not
      necessarily have all this lab work. The missing values are thus
      potentially informative.
