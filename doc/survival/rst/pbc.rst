      .. rubric:: Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cholangitis Data
         :name: mayo-clinic-primary-biliary-cholangitis-data

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disease leading to
      destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver. Progression is
      slow but inexhortable, eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver
      decompensation. The condition has been recognised since at least
      1851 and was named "primary biliary cirrhosis" in 1949. Because
      cirrhosis is a feature only of advanced disease, a change of its
      name to "primary biliary cholangitis" was proposed by patient
      advocacy groups in 2014.

      This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in PBC conducted between
      1974 and 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo
      Clinic during that ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for
      the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug
      D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the data set participated
      in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data. The
      additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical trial,
      but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be
      followed for survival. Six of those cases were lost to follow-up
      shortly after diagnosis, so the data here are on an additional 106
      cases as well as the 312 randomized participants.

      A nearly identical data set found in appendix D of Fleming and
      Harrington; this version has fewer missing values.
