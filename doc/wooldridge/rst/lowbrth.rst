      This data set can be used very much like INFMRT.RAW. It contains
      two years of state-level panel data. In fact, it is a superset of
      INFMRT.RAW. The key is that it contains information on low birth
      weights, as well as infant mortality. It also contains state
      identifies, so that several years of more recent data could be
      added for a term project. Putting in the variable afcdprc and its
      square leads to some interesting findings for pooled OLS and fixed
      effects (first differencing). After differencing, you can even try
      using the change in the AFDC payments variable as an instrumental
      variable for the change in afdcprc.
