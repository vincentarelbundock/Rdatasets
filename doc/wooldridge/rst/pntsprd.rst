      -  **fav25:** =1 if favored team in top 25

      -  **und25:** =1 if underdog in top 25

      -  **fregion:** favorite's region of country

      -  **uregion:** underdog's region of country

      The data are for the 1994-1995 menâ€™s college basketball seasons.
      The spread is for the day before the game was played. One might
      collect more recent data and determine whether the spread has
      become a less accurate predictor of the actual outcome in more
      recent years. In other words, in the simple regression of the
      actual score differential on the spread, is the variance larger in
      more recent years. (We should fully expect the slope coefficient
      not to be statistically different from one.)
