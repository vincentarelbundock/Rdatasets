      Wooldridge Source: I took a random sample of data reported in the

      This kind of data collection is relatively easy for students just
      learning data analysis, and the findings can be interesting. A
      good term project is to have students collect a similar data set
      using a more recent issue of Businessweek, and to find additional
      variables that might explain differences in CEO compensation. My
      impression is that the public is still interested in CEO
      compensation. An interesting question is whether the list of
      explanatory variables included in this data set now explain less
      of the variation in log(salary) than they used to.
