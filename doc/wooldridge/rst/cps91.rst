      This is much bigger than the other CPS data sets even though the
      sample is restricted to married women. (CPS91.RAW contains many
      more observations than MROZ.RAW, too.) In addition to the usual
      human capital variables for the women in the sample, we have
      information on the husband. Therefore, we can estimate a labor
      supply function as in Chapter 16, although the validity of
      potential experience as an IV for log(wage) is questionable.
      (MROZ.RAW contains an actual experience variable.) Perhaps more
      convincing is to add hours to the wage offer equation, and
      instrument hours with indicators for young and old children. This
      data set also contains a union membership indicator. The web site
      for the National Bureau of Economic Research makes it very easy
      now to download CPS data files in a variety offormats. Go to
