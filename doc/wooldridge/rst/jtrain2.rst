      Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs with Experimental
      Data,” American Economic Review 76, 604-620. Professor Jeff
      Biddle, at MSU, kindly passed the data set along to me. He
      obtained it from Professor Lalonde. Data loads lazily.

      A data.frame with 445 observations on 19 variables:

      -  **train:** =1 if assigned to job training

      -  **age:** age in 1977

      -  **educ:** years of education

      -  **black:** =1 if black

      -  **hisp:** =1 if Hispanic

      -  **married:** =1 if married

      -  **nodegree:** =1 if no high school degree

      -  **mosinex:** # mnths prior to 1/78 in expmnt

      -  **re74:** real earns., 1974, $1000s

      -  **re75:** real earns., 1975, $1000s

      -  **re78:** real earns., 1978, $1000s

      -  **unem74:** =1 if unem. all of 1974

      -  **unem75:** =1 if unem. all of 1975

      -  **unem78:** =1 if unem. all of 1978

      -  **lre74:** log(re74); zero if re74 == 0

      -  **lre75:** log(re75); zero if re75 == 0

      -  **lre78:** log(re78); zero if re78 == 0

      -  **agesq:** age^2

      -  **mostrn:** months in training

      Professor Lalonde obtained the data from the National Supported
      Work Demonstration job-training program conducted by the Manpower
      Demonstration Research Corporation in the mid 1970s. Training
      status was randomly assigned, so this is essentially experimental
      data. Computer Exercise C17.8 looks only at the effects of
      training on subsequent unemployment probabilities. For
      illustrating the more advanced methods in Chapter 17, a good
      exercise would be to have the students estimate a Tobit of re78 on
      train, and obtain estimates of the expected values for those with
      and without training. These can be compared with the sample
      averages.
