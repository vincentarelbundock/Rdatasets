      Wooldridge Source: These data were collected by David Dicicco, a
      former MSU undergraduate, for a final project. They came from
      various issues of the County and City Data Book, and are for the
      years 1982 and 1985. Unfortunately, I do not have the list of
      cities. Data loads lazily.

      Very rich crime data sets, at the county, or even city, level, can
      be collected using the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reports. These data can
      be matched up with demographic and economic data, at least for
      census years. The County and City Data Book contains a variety of
      statistics, but the years do not always match up. These data sets
      can be used investigate issues such as the effects of casinos on
      city or county crime rates.
