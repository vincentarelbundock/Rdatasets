      Wooldridge Source: These data were used in the doctoral
      dissertation of Jeffrey Blend, Department of Agricultural
      Economics, Michigan State University, 1998. The thesis was
      supervised by Professor Eileen van Ravensway. Drs. Blend and van
      Ravensway kindly provided the data, which were obtained from a
      telephone survey conducted by the Institute for Public Policy and
      Social Research at MSU. Data loads lazily.

      This data set is close to a true experimental data set because the
      price pairs facing a family were randomly determined. In other
      words, the family head was presented with prices for the
      eco-labeled and regular apples, and then asked how much of each
      kind of apple the family would buy at the given prices. As
      predicted by basic economics, the own price effect is negative
      (and strong) and the cross price effect is positive (and strong).
      While the main dependent variable, ecolbs, piles up at zero,
      estimating a linear model is still worthwhile. Interestingly,
      because the survey design induces a strong positive correlation
      between the prices of eco-labeled and regular apples, there is an
      omitted variable problem if either of the price variables is
      dropped from the demand equation. A good exam question is to show
      a simple regression of ecolbs on ecoprc and then a multiple
      regression on both prices, and ask students to decide whether the
      price variables must be positively or negatively correlated.
