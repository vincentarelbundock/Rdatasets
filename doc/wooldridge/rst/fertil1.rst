      (1) Much more recent data can be obtained from the National
      Opinion Research Center website,
      http://www.norc.org/GSS+Website/Download/. Very rich pooled cross
      sections can be constructed to study a variety of issues – not
      just changes in fertility over time. It would be interesting to
      analyze a similar data set for a developing country, especially
      where efforts have been made to emphasize birth control. Some
      measure of access to birth control could be useful if it varied by
      region. Sometimes, one can find policy changes in the
      advertisement or availability of contraceptives.
