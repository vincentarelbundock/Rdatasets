      A data.frame with 29 observations on 6 variables:

      -  **rd:** R&D spending, millions $

      -  **sales:** firm sales, millions $

      -  **rdintens:** rd as percent of sales

      -  **lrd:** log(rd)

      -  **lsales:** log(sales)

      -  **salessq:** sales^2

      .. rubric:: Notes
         :name: notes

      According to these data, the R&D/firm size relationship is
      different in the telecommunications industry than in the chemical
      industry: there is pretty strong evidence that R&D intensity
      decreases with firm size in telecommunications. Of course, that
      was in 1991. The data could easily be updated, and a panel data
      set could be constructed.
