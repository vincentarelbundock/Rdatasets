      In their article, Biddle and Hamermesh include an hourly wage
      measure in the sleep equation. An econometric problem that arises
      is that the hourly wage is missing for those who do not work.
      Plus, the wage offer may be endogenous (even if it were always
      observed). Biddle and Hamermesh employ extensions of the sample
      selection methods in Section 17.5. See their article for details.
