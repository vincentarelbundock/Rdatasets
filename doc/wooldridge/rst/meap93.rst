      Wooldridge Source: I collected these data from the old Michigan
      Department of Education web site. See MATHPNL.RAW for the current
      web site. I used data on most high schools in the state of
      Michigan for 1993. I dropped some high schools that had
      suspicious-looking data. Data loads lazily.

      Many states have data, at either the district or building level,
      on student performance and spending. A good exercise in data
      collection and cleaning is to have students find such data for a
      particular state, and to put it into a form that can be used for
      econometric analysis.
