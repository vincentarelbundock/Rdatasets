      Wooldridge Source: These data were obtained by James Heakins, a
      former MSU undergraduate, for a term project. They come from
      Botswana’s 1988 Demographic and Health Survey. Data loads lazily.

      Currently, this data set is used only in one computer exercise.
      Since the dependent variable of interest – number of living
      children or number of children every born – is a count variable,
      the Poisson regression model discussed in Chapter 17 can be used.
      However, some care is required to combine Poisson regression with
      an endogenous explanatory variable (educ). I refer you to Chapter
      19 of my book Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel
      Data. Even in the context of linear models, much can be done
      beyond Computer Exercise C15.2. At a minimum, the binary
      indicators for various religions can be added as controls. One
      might also interact the schooling variable, educ, with some of the
      exogenous explanatory variables.
