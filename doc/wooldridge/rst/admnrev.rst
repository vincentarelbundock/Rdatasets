      Wooldridge Source: Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety
      Administration: “A Digest of State Alcohol-Highway Safety Related
      Legislation,” U.S. Department of Transportation, NHTSA. I used the
      third (1985), eighth (1990), and 13th (1995) editions. Data loads
      lazily.

      ::

         data('admnrev')

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data.frame with 153 observations on 5 variables:

      -  **state:** state postal code

      -  **year:** 85, 90, or 95

      -  **admnrev:** =1 if admin. revoc. law

      -  **daysfrst:** days suspended, first offense

      -  **daysscnd:** days suspended, second offense

      .. rubric:: Notes
         :name: notes

      This is not so much a data set as a summary of so-called
      “administrative per se” laws atthe state level, for three
      different years. It could be supplemented with drunk-driving
      fatalities for a nice econometric analysis. In addition, the data
      for 2000 or later years can be added, forming the basis for a term
      project. Many other explanatory variables could be included.
      Unemployment rates, state-level tax rates on alcohol, and
      membership in MADD are just a few possibilities.
