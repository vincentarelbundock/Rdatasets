      This is an unbalanced panel data set in the sense that as many as
      three years of data are available for each faculty member but
      where some have fewer than three years. It is not clear that
      something like a fixed effects or first differencing analysis
      makes sense: in effect, approaches that remove the heterogeneity
      control for too much by controlling for unobserved heterogeneity
      which, in this case, includes faculty intelligence, talent, and
      motivation. Presumably these factors enter into the publication
      index. It is hard to think we want to hold the main factors
      driving productivity fixed when trying to measure the effect of
      productivity on salary. Pooled OLS regression with “cluster
      robust” standard errors seems more natural. On the other hand, if
      we want to measure the return to having a degree from a top 20
      Ph.D. program then we would want to control for factors that cause
      selection into a top 20 program. Unfortunately, this variable does
      not change over time, and so FD and FE are not applicable.
