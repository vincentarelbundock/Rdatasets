      A data.frame with 21 observations on 5 variables:

      -  **country:**

      -  **alcohol:** liters alcohol from wine, per capita

      -  **deaths:** deaths per 100,000

      -  **heart:** heart disease dths per 100,000

      -  **liver:** liver disease dths per 100,000

      .. rubric:: Notes
         :name: notes

      The dependent variables deaths, heart, and liver can be each
      regressed against alcohol as nice simple regression examples. The
      conventional wisdom is that wine is good for the heart but not for
      the liver, something that is apparent in the regressions. Because
      the number of observations is small, this can be a good data set
      to illustrate calculation of the OLS estimates and statistics.
