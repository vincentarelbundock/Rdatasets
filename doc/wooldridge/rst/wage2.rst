      Ability, Efficiency Wages, and Interindustry Wage Differentials,”

      kindly provided the data, of which I used just the data for 1980.

      As with WAGE1.RAW, there are some clear inconsistencies among the
      variables tenure, exper, and age. I have not been able to track
      down the causes, and so any changes would be effectively
      arbitrary. Instead, I am using the data as provided by the authors
      of the above QJE article.
