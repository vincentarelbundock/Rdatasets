   Wooldridge Source: L.E. Papke (1995), “Participation in and
   Contributions to 401(k) Pension Plans:Evidence from Plan Data,”
   Journal of Human Resources 30, 311-325. Professor Papke kindly
   provided these data. She gathered them from the Internal Revenue
   Service’s Form 5500 tapes. Data loads lazily.

      :name: format

   A data.frame with 1534 observations on 8 variables:

   -  **prate:** participation rate, percent

   -  **mrate:** 401k plan match rate

   -  **totpart:** total 401k participants

   -  **totelg:** total eligible for 401k plan

   -  **age:** age of 401k plan

   -  **totemp:** total number of firm employees

   -  **sole:** = 1 if 401k is firm's sole plan

   -  **ltotemp:** log of totemp

   .. rubric:: Notes
      :name: notes

   This data set is used in a variety of ways in the text. One
   additional possibility is to investigate whether the coefficients
   from the regression of prate on mrate, log(totemp) differ by whether
   the plan is a sole plan. The Chow test (see Section 7.4), and the
   less restrictive version that allows different intercepts, can be
   used.
