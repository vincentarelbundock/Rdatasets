      Wooldridge Source: Data on NCAA men’s basketball teams, collected
      by Weizhao Sun for a senior seminar project in sports economics at
      Michigan State University, Spring 2017. He used various sources,
      including www.espn.com and
      www.teamrankings.com/ncaa-basketball/rpi-ranking/rpi-rating-by-team.

      This is a nice example of how multiple regression analysis can be
      used to determine whether rankings compiled by experts – the
      so-called pre-season RPI in this case – provide additional
      information beyond what we can obtain from widely available data
      bases. A simple and interesting question is whether, once the
      previous year’s post-season RPI is controlled for, does the
      pre-season RPI – which is supposed to add information on
      recruiting and player development – help to predict performance
      (such as win percentage or making it to the NCAA men’s basketball
      tournament). For the binary outcome that indicates making it to
      the NCAA tournament, a probit or logit model can be used for
      courses that introduce more advanced methods. There are some other
      interesting variables, such as coaching experience, that can be
      included, too.
