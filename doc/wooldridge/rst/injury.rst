      This data set also can be used to illustrate the Chow test in
      Chapter 7. In particular, students can test whether the regression
      functions differ between Kentucky and Michigan. Or, allowing for
      different intercepts for the two states, do the slopes differ? A
      good lesson from this example is that a small R-squared is
      compatible with the ability to estimate the effects of a policy.
      Of course, for the Michigan data, which has a smaller sample size,
      the estimated effect is much less precise (but of virtually
      identical magnitude).
