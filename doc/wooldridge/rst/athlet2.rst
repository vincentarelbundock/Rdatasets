      These data were collected by Paul Anderson, an MSU economics
      major, for a term project. The score from football outcomes for
      natural rivals (Michigan-Michigan State, California-Stanford,
      Florida-Florida State, to name a few) is matched with application
      and academic data. The application and tuition data are for Fall
      1994. Football records and scores are from 1993 football season.
      Extended these data to obtain a long stretch of panel data and
      other “natural” rivals could be very interesting.
