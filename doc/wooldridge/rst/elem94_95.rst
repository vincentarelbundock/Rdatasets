   Starting in 1995, the Michigan Department of Education stopped
   reporting average teacher benefits along with average salary. This
   data set includes both variables, at the school level, and can be
   used to study the salary-benefits tradeoff, as in Chapter 4. There
   are a few suspicious benefits/salary ratios, and so this data set
   makes a good illustration of the impact of outliers in Chapter 9.
