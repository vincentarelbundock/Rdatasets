      Starting in 1995, the Michigan Department of Education stopped
      reporting average teacher benefits along with average salary. This
      data set includes both variables, at the school level, and can be
      used to study the salary-benefits tradeoff, as in Chapter 4. There
      are a few suspicious benefits/salary ratios, and so this data set
      makes a good illustration of the impact of outliers in Chapter 9.
