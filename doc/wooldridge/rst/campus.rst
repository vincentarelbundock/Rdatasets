      FBI Uniform Crime Reports and are for the year 1992. Data loads
      lazily.

      Colleges and universities are now required to provide much better,
      more detailed crime data. A very rich data set can now be
      obtained, even a panel data set for colleges across different
      years. Statistics on male/female ratios, fraction of men/women in
      fraternities or sororities, policy variables – such as a “safe
      house” for women on campus, as was started at MSU in 1994 – could
      be added as explanatory variables. The crime rate in the host town
      would be a good control.
