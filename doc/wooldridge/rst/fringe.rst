      Currently, this data set is used in only one Computer Exercise –
      to illustrate the Tobit model. It can be used much earlier. First,
      one could just ignore the pileup at zero and use a linear model
      where any of the hourly benefit measures is the dependent
      variable. Another possibility is to use this data set for a
      problem set in Chapter 4, after students have read Example 4.10.
      That example, which uses teacher salary/benefit data at the school
      level, finds the expected tradeoff, although it appears to less
      than one-to-one. By contrast, if you do a similar analysis with
      FRINGE.RAW, you will not find a tradeoff. A positive coefficient
      on the benefit/salary ratio is not too surprising because we
      probably cannot control for enough factors, especially when
      looking across different occupations. The Michigan school-level
      data is more aggregated than one would like, but it does restrict
      attention to a more homogeneous group: high school teachers in
      Michigan.
