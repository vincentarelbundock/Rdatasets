      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data set used in McCullagh & Nelder (1989), Hardin & Hilbe (2003),
      and other sources. The data contains values on the number of
      reported accidents for ships belonging to a company over a given
      time period. When a ship was constructed is also recorded.

         data(ships)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 40 observations on the following 7 variables.

      ``accident``
         number of shipping accidents

      ``op``
         1=ship operated 1975-1979;0=1965-74

      ``co.65.69``
         ship was in construction 1965-1969 (1/0)

      ``co.70.74``
         ship was in construction 1970-1974 (1/0)

      ``co.75.79``
         ship was in construction 1975-1979 (1/0)

      ``service``
         months in service

      ``ship``
         ship identification : 1-5

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ships is saved as a data frame. Count models use accident as the
      response variable, with log(service) as the offset. ship can be
      used as a panel identifier.
