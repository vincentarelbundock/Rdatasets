      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      The fishing data is adapted from Zuur, Hilbe and Ieno (2013) to
      determine whether the data appears to be generated from more than
      one generating mechanism. The data are originally adapted from
      Bailey et al. (2008) who were interested in how certain deep-sea
      fish populations were impacted when commercial fishing began in
      locations with deeper water than in previous years. Given that
      there are 147 sites that were researched, the model is of (1) the
      total number of fish counted per site (totabund); ( 2) on the mean
      water depth per site (meandepth); (3) adjusted by the area of the
      site (sweptarea); (4) the log of which is the model offset.

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 147 observations on the following variables.

      ``totabund``
         total fish counted per site

      ``meandepth``
         mean water depth per site

      ``sweptarea``
         adjusted area of site

      ``density``
         folage density index

      ``site``
         catch site

      ``year``
         1977-2002

      ``period``
         0=1977-1989; 1=2000+

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      fishing is saved as a data frame. Count models use totabund as
      response variable. Counts start at 2
