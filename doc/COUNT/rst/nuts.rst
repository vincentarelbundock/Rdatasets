      Squirrel data set (nuts) from Zuur, Hilbe, and Ieno (2013). As
      originally reported by Flaherty et al (2012), researchers recorded
      information about squirrel behavior and forest attributes across
      various plots in Scotland's Abernathy Forest. The study focused on
      the following variables. response cones number of cones stripped
      by red squirrels per plot predictor sntrees standardized number of
      trees per plot sheight standardized mean tree height per plot
      scover standardized percentage of canopy cover per plot The
      stripped cone count was only taken when the mean diameter of trees
      was under 0.6m (dbh).

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 52 observations on the following 8 variables.

      ``cones``
         number cones stripped by squirrels

      ``ntrees``
         number of trees per plot

      ``dbh``
         number DBH per plot

      ``height``
         mean tree height per plot

      ``cover``
         canopy closure (as a percentage)

      ``sntrees``
         standardized number of trees per plot

      ``sheight``
         standardized mean tree height per plot

      ``scover``
         standardized canopy closure (as a percentage)

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      nuts is saved as a data frame. Count models use ntrees as response
      variable. Counts start at 3
