         :name: description

      Data from a subset of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The
      subset was created by Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2005). Only
      working women are included in these data. Beginning in 1997,
      German health reform in part entailed a 200 co-payment as well as
      limits in provider reimbursement. Patients were surveyed for the
      one year panel (1996) prior to and the one year panel (1998) after
      reform to assess whether the number of physician visits by
      patients declined - which was the goal of reform legislation. The
      response, or variable to be explained by the model, is numvisit,
      which indicates the number of patient visits to a physician's
      office during a three month period.
