         :name: description

      The US national Medicare inpatient hospital database is referred
      to as the Medpar data, which is prepared yearly from hospital
      filing records. Medpar files for each state are also prepared. The
      full Medpar data consists of 115 variables. The national Medpar
      has some 14 million records, with one record for each
      hospilitiztion. The data in the medpar file comes from 1991
      Medicare files for the state of Arizona. The data are limited to
      only one diagnostic group (DRG 112). Patient data have been
      randomly selected from the original data.
