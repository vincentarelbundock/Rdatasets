         :name: description

      Data from Fair (1978). Although Fair used a tobit model with the
      data, the outcome measure can be modeled as a count. In fact,
      Greene (2003) modeled it as Poisson, but given the amount of
      overdispersion in the data, employing a negative binomial model is
      an appropriate strategy. The data is stored in the affairs data
      set. Naffairs is the response variable, indicating the number of
      affairs reported by the participant in the past year.
