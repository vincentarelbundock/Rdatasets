<dt>gender</dt><dd><p>factor. Gender of the player (or team of players).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Myopic loss aversion is a phenomenon in behavioral economics,
where individuals do not behave economically rationally when making short-term
decisions under uncertainty. Example: In lotteries with positive expected payouts
investments are lower than the maximum possible (loss aversion). This effect
is enhanced for short-term investments (myopia or short-sightedness).
</p>
<p>The data in <code>LossAversion</code> were collected by Matthias Sutter and
Daniela Glätzle-Rützler (Universität Innsbruck) in an experiment with
high-school students in Tyrol, Austria (Schwaz and Innsbruck). The students
could invest X points (0-100) in each of 9 rounds in a lottery. The payouts
were 100 + 2.5 * X points with probability 1/3 and 100 - X points with
probability 2/3. Thus, the expected payouts were 100 + 1/6 * X points.
Depending on the treatment in the experiment, the investments could either be
modified in each round (treatment: &quot;short&quot;) or only in round 1, 4, 7
(treatment &quot;long&quot;). Decisions were either made alone or in teams of two. The
points were converted to monetary payouts using a conversion of
EUR 0.5 per 100 points for lower grades (Unterstufe, 6-8) or EUR 1.0 per 100
points for upper grades (Oberstufe, 10-12).
</p>
<p>From the myopic loss aversion literature (on adults) one would expect that the
investments of the players (either single players or teams of two) would
depend on all factors: Investments should be </p>

<ul>
<li><p> lower in the short treatment (which would indicate myopia),
</p>
</li>
<li><p> higher for teams (indicating a reduction in loss aversion),
</p>
</li>
<li><p> higher for (teams with) male players,
</p>
</li>
<li><p> increase with age/grade.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>See Glätzle-Rützler et al. (2015) for more details and references to the
literature. In their original analysis, the investments are analyzes using
a panel structure (i.e., 9 separate investments for each team). Here, the
data are averaged across rounds for each player, leading to qualitatively
similar results. The full data along with replication materials are available
in the Harvard Dataverse.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>options(digits = 4)

## data and add ad-hoc scaling (a la Smithson &amp; Verkuilen)
data("LossAversion", package = "betareg")
LossAversion &lt;- transform(LossAversion,
  invests = (invest * (nrow(LossAversion) - 1) + 0.5)/nrow(LossAversion))


## models: normal (with constant variance), beta, extended-support beta mixture
la_n &lt;- lm(invest ~ grade * (arrangement + age) + male, data = LossAversion)
summary(la_n)


la_b &lt;- betareg(invests ~ grade * (arrangement + age) + male | arrangement + male + grade,
  data = LossAversion)
summary(la_b)

la_xbx &lt;- betareg(invest ~ grade * (arrangement + age) + male | arrangement + male + grade,
  data = LossAversion)
summary(la_xbx)

## coefficients in XBX are typically somewhat shrunken compared to beta
cbind(XBX = coef(la_xbx), Beta = c(coef(la_b), NA))


## predictions on subset: (at least one) male players, higher grades, around age 16
la &lt;- subset(LossAversion, male == "yes" &amp; grade == "10-12" &amp; age &gt;= 15 &amp;  age &lt;= 17)
la_nd &lt;- data.frame(arrangement = c("single", "team"), male = "yes", age = 16, grade = "10-12")

## empirical vs fitted E(Y)
la_nd$mean_emp &lt;- aggregate(invest ~ arrangement, data = la, FUN = mean)$invest 
la_nd$mean_n &lt;- predict(la_n, la_nd)
la_nd$mean_b &lt;- predict(la_b, la_nd)
la_nd$mean_xbx &lt;- predict(la_xbx, la_nd)
la_nd

## visualization: all means rather similar
la_mod &lt;- c("Emp", "N", "B", "XBX")
la_col &lt;- unname(palette.colors())[c(1, 2, 4, 4)]
la_lty &lt;- c(1, 5, 5, 1)
matplot(la_nd[, paste0("mean_", tolower(la_mod))], type = "l",
  col = la_col, lty = la_lty, lwd = 2, ylab = "E(Y)", main = "E(Y)", xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = 1:2, labels = la_nd$arrangement)
legend("topleft", la_mod, col = la_col, lty = la_lty, lwd = 2, bty = "n")


## empirical vs. fitted P(Y &gt; 0.95)
la_nd$prob_emp &lt;- aggregate(invest &gt;= 0.95 ~ arrangement, data = la, FUN = mean)$invest
la_nd$prob_n &lt;- pnorm(0.95, mean = la_nd$mean_n, sd = summary(la_n)$sigma, lower.tail = FALSE)
la_nd$prob_b &lt;- 1 - predict(la_b, la_nd, type = "probability", at = 0.95)
la_nd$prob_xbx &lt;- 1 - predict(la_xbx, la_nd, type = "probability", at = 0.95)
la_nd[, -(5:8)]

## visualization: only XBX works well
matplot(la_nd[, paste0("prob_", tolower(la_mod))], type = "l",
  col = la_col, lty = la_lty, lwd = 2, ylab = "P(Y &gt; 0.95)", main = "P(Y &gt; 0.95)", xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = 1:2, labels = la_nd$arrangement)
legend("topleft", la_mod, col = la_col, lty = la_lty, lwd = 2, bty = "n")
