         :name: confidence-of-mock-jurors-in-their-verdicts

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Data with responses of naive mock jurors to the conventional
      conventional two-option verdict (guilt vs. acquittal) versus a
      three-option verdict setup (the third option was the Scottish 'not
      proven' alternative), in the presence/absence of conflicting
      testimonial evidence.

         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("MockJurors")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame containing 104 observations on 3 variables.

      verdict
         factor indicating whether a two-option or three-option verdict
         is requested. (A sum contrast rather than treatment contrast is
         employed.)

      conflict
         factor. Is there conflicting testimonial evidence? (A sum
         contrast rather than treatment contrast is employed.)

      confidence
         jurors degree of confidence in his/her verdict, scaled to the
         open unit interval (see below).

      The data were collected by Daily (2004) among first-year
      psychology students at Australian National University. Smithson
      and Verkuilen (2006) employed the data scaling the original
      confidence (on a scale 0–100) to the open unit interval:
      ``((original_confidence/100) * 103 - 0.5) / 104``.

      The original coding of ``conflict`` in the data provided from
      Smithson's homepage is -1/1 which Smithson and Verkuilen (2006)
      describe to mean no/yes. However, all their results (sample
      statistics, histograms, etc.) suggest that it actually means
      yes/no which was employed in ``MockJurors``.
