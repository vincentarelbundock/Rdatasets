      gasoline after distillation and fractionation.

      A data frame containing 32 observations on 6 variables.

      yield
         proportion of crude oil converted to gasoline after
         distillation and fractionation.

      gravity
         crude oil gravity (degrees API).

      pressure
         vapor pressure of crude oil (lbf/in2).

      temp10
         temperature (degrees F) at which 10 percent of crude oil has
         vaporized.

      temp
         temperature (degrees F) at which all gasoline has vaporized.

      batch
         factor indicating unique batch of conditions ``gravity``,
         ``pressure``, and ``temp10``.

      This dataset was collected by Prater (1956), its dependent
      variable is the proportion of crude oil after distillation and
      fractionation. This dataset was analyzed by Atkinson (1985), who
      used the linear regression model and noted that there is
      “indication that the error distribution is not quite symmetrical,
      giving rise to some unduly large and small residuals” (p. 60).

      The dataset contains 32 observations on the response and on the
      independent variables. It has been noted (Daniel and Wood, 1971,
      Chapter 8) that there are only ten sets of values of the first
      three explanatory variables which correspond to ten different
      crudes and were subjected to experimentally controlled
      distillation conditions. These conditions are captured in variable
      ``batch`` and the data were ordered according to the ascending
      order of ``temp10``.
