      .. rubric:: Imprecise Probabilities for Sunday Weather and Boeing
         Stock Task
         :name: imprecise-probabilities-for-sunday-weather-and-boeing-stock-task

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      In this study participants were asked to estimate upper and lower
      probabilities for event to occur and not to occur.

         :name: usage

      ::

         data(ImpreciseTask)

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame with 242 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``task``
         a factor with levels ``Boeing stock`` and ``Sunday weather``.

      ``location``
         a numeric vector of the average of the lower estimate for the
         event not to occur and the upper estimate for the event to
         occur.

      ``difference``
         a numeric vector of the differences of the lower and upper
         estimate for the event to occur.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      All participants in the study were either first- or second-year
      undergraduate students in psychology, none of whom had a strong
      background in probability or were familiar with imprecise
      probability theories.

      For the sunday weather task see ``WeatherTask``. For the Boeing
      stock task participants were asked to estimate the probability
      that Boeing's stock would rise more than those in a list of 30
      companies.

      For each task participants were asked to provide lower and upper
      estimates for the event to occur and not to occur.
