      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      In this study participants were asked to judge how likely Sunday
      is to be the hottest day of the week.

      A data frame with 345 observations on the following 3 variables.

      ``priming``
         a factor with levels ``two-fold`` (case prime) and
         ``seven-fold`` (class prime).

      ``eliciting``
         a factor with levels ``precise`` and ``imprecise`` (lower and
         upper limit).

      ``agreement``
         a numeric vector, probability indicated by participants or the
         average between minimum and maximum probability indicated.

      All participants in the study were either first- or second-year
      undergraduate students in psychology, none of whom had a strong
      background in probability or were familiar with imprecise
      probability theories.

      For ``priming`` the questions were:

      two-fold
         [What is the probability that] the temperature at Canberra
         airport on Sunday will be higher than every other day next
         week?

      seven-fold
         [What is the probability that] the highest temperature of the
         week at Canberra airport will occur on Sunday?

      For ``eliciting`` the instructions were if

      precise
         to assign a probability estimate,

      imprecise
         to assign a lower and upper probability estimate.
