      These are episode-contestant-level data for RuPaul's Drag Race for
      all available seasons (currently through Season 14). For a given
      season, observations mostly decrease with each episode. Data
      include all sorts of information.

      A data frame with the following 11 variables.

      ``season``
         a character vector for the season

      ``rank``
         a numeric vector for the final rank of the contestant

      ``contestant``
         a character vector for the contestant's name

      ``missc``
         a dummy variable indicating if the contestant was Miss
         Congeniality

      ``episode``
         a numeric vector for the episode number

      ``outcome``
         a character vector for the outcome for the queen after the main
         challenge

      ``eliminated``
         a character vector (0,1) for if the queen was
         eliminated/removed from the competition after the episode

      ``participant``
         a character vector (0,1) for if the queen was a participant in
         the show

      ``minichalw``
         a character vector (0,1) if the queen won a mini-challenge that
         episode. NOTE: this is a work in progress. For now, I encourage
         getting the mini-challenge data from one of the other data
         sets.

      ``finale``
         a numeric vector for if the episode was the finale

      ``penultimate``
         a numeric vector for if the episode was the penultimate before
         the finale. Applicable to seasons 6, 7, and 8.
