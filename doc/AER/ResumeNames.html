<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cross-section data about resume, call-back and employer information for 4,870 fictitious
resumes sent in response to employment advertisements in Chicago and Boston in 2001, 
in a randomized controlled experiment conducted by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004).
The resumes contained information concerning the ethnicity of the applicant.
Because ethnicity is not typically included on a resume, resumes were differentiated on
the basis of so-called &ldquo;Caucasian sounding names&rdquo; (such as Emily Walsh or Gregory Baker)
and &ldquo;African American sounding names&rdquo; (such as Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones).
A large collection of fictitious resumes were created and the pre-supposed
ethnicity (based on the sound of the name) was randomly assigned to each resume.
These resumes were sent to prospective employers to see which resumes generated a phone call
from the prospective employer.
