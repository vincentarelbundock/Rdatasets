<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Rouse (1995) computed years of education by assigning 12 years to all
members of the senior class. Each additional year of secondary education counted as a
one year. Students with vocational degrees were assigned 13 years, AA degrees were
assigned 14 years, BA degrees were assigned 16 years, those with some graduate
education were assigned 17 years, and those with a graduate degree were assigned 18
years.
</p>
<p>Stock and Watson (2007) provide separate data files for the students from
Western states and the remaining students. <code>CollegeDistance</code> includes
both data sets, subsets are easily obtained (see also examples).
