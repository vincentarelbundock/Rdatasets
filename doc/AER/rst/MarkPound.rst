   .. rubric:: DEM/GBP Exchange Rate Returns
      :name: demgbp-exchange-rate-returns

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   A daily time series of percentage returns of Deutsche mark/British
   pound (DEM/GBP) exchange rates from 1984-01-03 through 1991-12-31.

   .. rubric:: Usage
      :name: usage

   ::

      data("MarkPound")

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A univariate time series of 1974 returns (exact dates unknown) for
   the DEM/GBP exchange rate.

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Greene (2003, Table F11.1) rounded the series to six digits while
   eight digits are given in Bollerslev and Ghysels (1996). Here, we
   provide the original data. Using ``round`` a series can be produced
   that is virtually identical to that of Greene (2003) (except for
   eight observations where a slightly different rounding arithmetic was
   used).

      ## data as given by Greene (2003)
      data("MarkPound")
      mp <- round(MarkPound, digits = 6)

      ## Figure 11.3 in Greene (2003)
      plot(mp)

      ## Example 11.8 in Greene (2003), Table 11.5
      library("tseries")
      mp_garch <- garch(mp, grad = "numerical")
      summary(mp_garch)
      logLik(mp_garch)  
      ## Greene (2003) also includes a constant and uses different
      ## standard errors (presumably computed from Hessian), here
      ## OPG standard errors are used. garchFit() in "fGarch"
      ## implements the approach used by Greene (2003).

      ## compare Errata to Greene (2003)
      library("dynlm")
      res <- residuals(dynlm(mp ~ 1))^2
      mp_ols <- dynlm(res ~ L(res, 1:10))
      summary(mp_ols)
      logLik(mp_ols)
      summary(mp_ols)$r.squared * length(residuals(mp_ols))
