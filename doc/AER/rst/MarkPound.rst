      .. rubric:: DEM/GBP Exchange Rate Returns
         :name: demgbp-exchange-rate-returns

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      A daily time series of percentage returns of Deutsche mark/British
      pound (DEM/GBP) exchange rates from 1984-01-03 through 1991-12-31.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("MarkPound")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A univariate time series of 1974 returns (exact dates unknown) for
      the DEM/GBP exchange rate.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Greene (2003, Table F11.1) rounded the series to six digits while
      eight digits are given in Bollerslev and Ghysels (1996). Here, we
      provide the original data. Using ``round`` a series can be
      produced that is virtually identical to that of Greene (2003)
      (except for eight observations where a slightly different rounding
      arithmetic was used).

         ## data as given by Greene (2003)
         data("MarkPound")
         mp <- round(MarkPound, digits = 6)

         ## Figure 11.3 in Greene (2003)
         plot(mp)

         ## Example 11.8 in Greene (2003), Table 11.5
         library("tseries")
         mp_garch <- garch(mp, grad = "numerical")
         summary(mp_garch)
         logLik(mp_garch)  
         ## Greene (2003) also includes a constant and uses different
         ## standard errors (presumably computed from Hessian), here
         ## OPG standard errors are used. garchFit() in "fGarch"
         ## implements the approach used by Greene (2003).

         ## compare Errata to Greene (2003)
         library("dynlm")
         res <- residuals(dynlm(mp ~ 1))^2
         mp_ols <- dynlm(res ~ L(res, 1:10))
         summary(mp_ols)
         logLik(mp_ols)
         summary(mp_ols)$r.squared * length(residuals(mp_ols))
