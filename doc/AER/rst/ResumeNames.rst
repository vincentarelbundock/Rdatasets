      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Cross-section data about resume, call-back and employer
      information for 4,870 fictitious resumes sent in response to
      employment advertisements in Chicago and Boston in 2001, in a
      randomized controlled experiment conducted by Bertrand and
      Mullainathan (2004). The resumes contained information concerning
      the ethnicity of the applicant. Because ethnicity is not typically
      included on a resume, resumes were differentiated on the basis of
      so-called “Caucasian sounding names” (such as Emily Walsh or
      Gregory Baker) and “African American sounding names” (such as
      Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones). A large collection of
      fictitious resumes were created and the pre-supposed ethnicity
      (based on the sound of the name) was randomly assigned to each
      resume. These resumes were sent to prospective employers to see
      which resumes generated a phone call from the prospective
      employer.
