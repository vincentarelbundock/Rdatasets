      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Cross-section data on the number of recreational boating trips to
      Lake Somerville, Texas, in 1980, based on a survey administered to
      2,000 registered leisure boat owners in 23 counties in eastern
      Texas.

      .. rubric:: Format

      A data frame containing 659 observations on 8 variables.

      trips
         Number of recreational boating trips.

      quality
         Facility's subjective quality ranking on a scale of 1 to 5.

      ski
         factor. Was the individual engaged in water-skiing at the lake?

      income
         Annual household income of the respondent (in 1,000 USD).

      userfee
         factor. Did the individual pay an annual user fee at Lake
         Somerville?

      costC
         Expenditure when visiting Lake Conroe (in USD).

      costS
         Expenditure when visiting Lake Somerville (in USD).

      costH
         Expenditure when visiting Lake Houston (in USD).

         :name: details

      According to the original source (Seller, Stoll and Chavas, 1985,
      p. 168), the quality rating is on a scale from 1 to 5 and gives 0
      for those who had not visited the lake. This explains the
      remarkably low mean for this variable, but also suggests that its
      treatment in various more recent publications is far from ideal.
      For consistency with other sources we handle the variable as a
      numerical variable, including the zeros.
