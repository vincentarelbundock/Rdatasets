      ``SportsCards`` contains data from 148 randomly selected traders
      who attended a trading card show in Orlando, Florida, in 1998.
      Traders were randomly given one of two sports collectables, say
      good A or good B, that had approximately equal market value. Those
      receiving good A were then given the option of trading good A for
      good B with the experimenter; those receiving good B were given
      the option of trading good B for good A with the experimenter.
      Good A was a ticket stub from the game that Cal Ripken Jr. set the
      record for consecutive games played, and Good B was a souvenir
      from the game that Nolan Ryan won his 300th game.
