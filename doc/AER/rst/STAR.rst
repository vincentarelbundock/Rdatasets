      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio) was a four-year
      longitudinal class-size study funded by the Tennessee General
      Assembly and conducted in the late 1980s by the State Department
      of Education. Over 7,000 students in 79 schools were randomly
      assigned into one of three interventions: small class (13 to 17
      students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25 students per
      teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a
      full-time teacher's aide). Classroom teachers were also randomly
      assigned to the classes they would teach. The interventions were
      initiated as the students entered school in kindergarten and
      continued through third grade.

      The Project STAR public access data set contains data on test
      scores, treatment groups, and student and teacher characteristics
      for the four years of the experiment, from academic year 1985–1986
      to academic year 1988–1989. The test score data analyzed in this
      chapter are the sum of the scores on the math and reading portion
      of the Stanford Achievement Test.

      Stock and Watson (2007) obtained the data set from the Project
      STAR Web site.

      The data is provided in wide format. Reshaping it into long format
      is illustrated below. Note that the levels of the ``degree``,
      ``ladder`` and ``tethnicity`` variables differ slightly between
      kindergarten and higher grades.
