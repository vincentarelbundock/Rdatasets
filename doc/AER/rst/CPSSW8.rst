      Stock and Watson (2007) provide several subsets created from March
      Current Population Surveys (CPS) with data on the relationship of
      earnings and education over several year.

      Each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US Department of
      Labor conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides
      data on labor force characteristics of the population, including
      the level of employment, unemployment, and earnings. Approximately
      65,000 randomly selected US households are surveyed each month.
      The sample is chosen by randomly selecting addresses from a
      database. Details can be found in the Handbook of Labor Statistics
      and is described on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website
      (https://www.bls.gov/).

      The survey conducted each March is more detailed than in other
      months and asks questions about earnings during the previous year.
      The data sets contain data for 2004 (from the March 2005 survey),
      and some also for earlier years (up to 1992).

      If education is given, it is for full-time workers, defined as
      workers employed more than 35 hours per week for at least 48 weeks
      in the previous year. Data are provided for workers whose highest
      educational achievement is a high school diploma and a bachelor's
      degree.

      Earnings for years earlier than 2004 were adjusted for inflation
      by putting them in 2004 USD using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
      From 1992 to 2004, the price of the CPI market basket rose by
      34.6%. To make earnings in 1992 and 2004 comparable, 1992 earnings
      are inflated by the amount of overall CPI price inflation, by
      multiplying 1992 earnings by 1.346 to put them into 2004 dollars.

      ``CPSSW9204`` provides the distribution of earnings in the US in
      1992 and 2004 for college-educated full-time workers aged 25–34.
      ``CPSSW04`` is a subset of ``CPSSW9204`` and provides the
      distribution of earnings in the US in 2004 for college-educated
      full-time workers aged 25–34. ``CPSSWEducation`` is similar (but
      not a true subset) and contains the distribution of earnings in
      the US in 2004 for college-educated full-time workers aged 29–30.
      ``CPSSW8`` contains a larger sample with workers aged 21–64,
      additionally providing information about the region of residence.
      ``CPSSW9298`` is similar to ``CPSSW9204`` providing data from 1992
      and 1998 (with the 1992 subsets not being exactly identical).
      ``CPSSW3`` provides trends (from 1992 to 2004) in hourly earnings
      in the US of working college graduates aged 25–34 (in 2004 USD).
