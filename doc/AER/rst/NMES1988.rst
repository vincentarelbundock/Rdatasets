   .. rubric:: Demand for Medical Care in NMES 1988
      :name: NMES1988

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Cross-section data originating from the US National Medical
   Expenditure Survey (NMES) conducted in 1987 and 1988. The NMES is
   based upon a representative, national probability sample of the
   civilian non-institutionalized population and individuals admitted to
   long-term care facilities during 1987. The data are a subsample of
   individuals ages 66 and over all of whom are covered by Medicare (a
   public insurance program providing substantial protection against
   health-care costs).
