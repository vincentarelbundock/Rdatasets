      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Cross-section data for 9120 women taken from every fourth year of
      the US General Social Survey between 1974 and 2002 to investigate
      the determinants of fertility.

      A data frame containing 9120 observations on 10 variables.

      kids
         Number of children. This is coded as a numerical variable but
         note that the value ``8`` actually encompasses 8 or more
         children.

      age
         Age of respondent.

      education
         Highest year of school completed.

      year
         GSS year for respondent.

      siblings
         Number of brothers and sisters.

      agefirstbirth
         Woman's age at birth of first child.

      ethnicity
         factor indicating ethnicity. Is the individual Caucasian
         (``"cauc"``) or not (``"other"``)?

      city16
         factor. Did the respondent live in a city (with population >
         50,000) at age 16?

      lowincome16
         factor. Was the income below average at age 16?

      immigrant
         factor. Was the respondent (or both parents) born abroad?

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This subset of the US General Social Survey (GSS) for every fourth
      year between 1974 and 2002 has been selected by Winkelmann and
      Boes (2009) to investigate the determinants of fertility. To do so
      they typically restrict their empirical analysis to the women for
      which the completed fertility is (assumed to be) known, employing
      the common cutoff of 40 years. Both, the average number of
      children borne to a woman and the probability of being childless,
      are of interest.
