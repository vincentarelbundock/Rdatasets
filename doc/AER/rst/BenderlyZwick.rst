      An annual multiple time series from 1952 to 1982 with 5 variables.

      returns

         Ibbotson-Sinquefeld data base.

      growth
         annual growth rate of output, measured by real GNP (from the
         given year to the next year).

      inflation
         inflation rate, measured as growth of price rate (from December
         of the previous year to December of the present year).

      growth2
         annual growth rate of real GNP as given by Baltagi.

      inflation2

      The first three columns of the data are from Table 1 in Benderly
      and Zwick (1985). The remaining columns are taken from the online
      complements of Baltagi (2002). The first column is identical in
      both sources, the other two variables differ in their numeric
      values and additionally the growth series seems to be lagged
      differently. Baltagi (2002) states Lott and Ray (1992) as the
      source for his version of the data set.
