         :name: description

      Cross-section data originating from the 1976 Panel Study of Income
      Dynamics (PSID), based on data for the previous year, 1975.

      A data frame containing 753 observations on 21 variables.

      participation
         Factor. Did the individual participate in the labor force in
         1975? (This is essentially ``wage > 0`` or ``hours > 0``.)

      hours
         Wife's hours of work in 1975.

      youngkids
         Number of children less than 6 years old in household.

      oldkids
         Number of children between ages 6 and 18 in household.

      age
         Wife's age in years.

      education
         Wife's education in years.

      wage
         Wife's average hourly wage, in 1975 dollars.

      repwage
         Wife's wage reported at the time of the 1976 interview (not the
         same as the 1975 estimated wage). To use the subsample with
         this wage, one needs to select 1975 workers with
         ``participation == "yes"``, then select only those women with
         non-zero wage. Only 325 women work in 1975 and have a non-zero
         wage in 1976.

      hhours
         Husband's hours worked in 1975.

      hage
         Husband's age in years.

      heducation
         Husband's education in years.

      hwage
         Husband's wage, in 1975 dollars.

      fincome
         Family income, in 1975 dollars. (This variable is used to
         construct the property income variable.)

      tax
         Marginal tax rate facing the wife, and is taken from published
         federal tax tables (state and local income taxes are excluded).
         The taxable income on which this tax rate is calculated
         includes Social Security, if applicable to wife.

      meducation
         Wife's mother's educational attainment, in years.

      feducation
         Wife's father's educational attainment, in years.

      unemp
         Unemployment rate in county of residence, in percentage points.
         (This is taken from bracketed ranges.)

      city
         Factor. Does the individual live in a large city?

      experience
         Actual years of wife's previous labor market experience.

      college
         Factor. Did the individual attend college?

      hcollege
         Factor. Did the individual's husband attend college?

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This data set is also known as the Mroz (1987) data.

      Warning: Typical applications using these data employ the variable
      ``wage`` (aka ``earnings`` in previous versions of the data) as
      the dependent variable. The variable ``repwage`` is the reported
      wage in a 1976 interview, named RPWG by Greene (2003).
