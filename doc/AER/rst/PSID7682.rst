   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   The data were originally analyzed by Cornwell and Rupert (1988) and
   employed for assessing various instrumental-variable estimators for
   panel models (including the Hausman-Taylor model). Baltagi and
   Khanti-Akom (1990) reanalyzed the data, made corrections to the data
   and also suggest modeling with a different set of instruments.

   ``PSID7682`` is the version of the data as provided by Baltagi
   (2005), or Greene (2008).

   Baltagi (2002) just uses the cross-section for the year 1982, i.e.,
   ``subset(PSID7682, year == "1982")``. This is also available as a
   standalone data set ``PSID1982`` because it was included in AER prior
   to the availability of the full ``PSID7682`` panel version.
