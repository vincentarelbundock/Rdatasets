      The data were originally analyzed by Cornwell and Rupert (1988)
      and employed for assessing various instrumental-variable
      estimators for panel models (including the Hausman-Taylor model).
      Baltagi and Khanti-Akom (1990) reanalyzed the data, made
      corrections to the data and also suggest modeling with a different
      set of instruments.

      ``PSID7682`` is the version of the data as provided by Baltagi
      (2005), or Greene (2008).

      Baltagi (2002) just uses the cross-section for the year 1982,
      i.e., ``subset(PSID7682, year == "1982")``. This is also available
      as a standalone data set ``PSID1982`` because it was included in
      AER prior to the availability of the full ``PSID7682`` panel
      version.
