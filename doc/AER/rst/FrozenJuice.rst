      .. rubric:: Price of Frozen Orange Juice
         :name: price-of-frozen-orange-juice

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Monthly data on the price of frozen orange juice concentrate and
      temperature in the orange-growing region of Florida.

      .. rubric:: Format

      A monthly multiple time series from 1950(1) to 2000(12) with 3
      variables.

      price
         Average producer price for frozen orange juice.

      ppi
         Producer price index for finished goods. Used to deflate the
         overall producer price index for finished goods to eliminate
         the effects of overall price inflation.

      fdd
         Number of freezing degree days at the Orlando, Florida,
         airport. Calculated as the sum of the number of degrees
         Fahrenheit that the minimum temperature falls below freezing
         (32 degrees Fahrenheit = about 0 degrees Celsius) in a given
         day over all days in the month: ``fdd`` = sum(max(0, 32 -
         minimum daily temperature)), e.g. for February ``fdd`` is the
         number of freezing degree days from January 11 to February 10.

      The orange juice price data are the frozen orange juice component
      of processed foods and feeds group of the Producer Price Index
      (PPI), collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS series
      wpu02420301). The orange juice price series was divided by the
      overall PPI for finished goods to adjust for general price
      inflation. The freezing degree days series was constructed from
      daily minimum temperatures recorded at Orlando area airports,
      obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
      (NOAA) of the US Department of Commerce.
