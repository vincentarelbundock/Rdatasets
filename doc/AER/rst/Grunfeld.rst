      Panel data on 11 large US manufacturing firms over 20 years, for
      the years 1935–1954.

      A data frame containing 20 annual observations on 3 variables for
      11 firms.

      invest
         Gross investment, defined as additions to plant and equipment
         plus maintenance and repairs in millions of dollars deflated by
         the implicit price deflator of producers' durable equipment
         (base 1947).

      value
         Market value of the firm, defined as the price of common shares
         at December 31 (or, for WH, IBM and CH, the average price of
         December 31 and January 31 of the following year) times the
         number of common shares outstanding plus price of preferred
         shares at December 31 (or average price of December 31 and
         January 31 of the following year) times number of preferred
         shares plus total book value of debt at December 31 in millions
         of dollars deflated by the implicit GNP price deflator (base
         1947).

      capital
         Stock of plant and equipment, defined as the accumulated sum of
         net additions to plant and equipment deflated by the implicit
         price deflator for producers' durable equipment (base 1947)
         minus depreciation allowance deflated by depreciation expense
         deflator (10 years moving average of wholesale price index of
         metals and metal products, base 1947).

      firm
         factor with 11 levels: ``"General Motors"``, ``"US Steel"``,
         ``"General Electric"``, ``"Chrysler"``,
         ``"Atlantic Refining"``, ``"IBM"``, ``"Union Oil"``,
         ``"Westinghouse"``, ``"Goodyear"``, ``"Diamond Match"``,
         ``"American Steel"``.

      year
         Year.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      This is a popular data set for teaching purposes. Unfortunately,
      there exist several different versions (see Kleiber and Zeileis,
      2010, for a detailed discussion). In particular, the version
      provided by Greene (2003) has a couple of errors for
      ``"US Steel"`` (firm 2): investment in 1940 is 261.6 (instead of
      the correct 361.6), investment in 1952 is 645.2 (instead of the
      correct 645.5), capital in 1946 is 132.6 (instead of the correct
      232.6).

      Here, we provide the original data from Grunfeld (1958). The data
      for the first 10 firms are identical to those of Baltagi (2002) or
      Baltagi (2005), now also used by Greene (2008).

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      The data are taken from Grunfeld (1958, Appendix, Tables 2–9 and
      11–13).
