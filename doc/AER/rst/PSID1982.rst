      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``PSID1982`` is the cross-section for the year 1982 taken from a
      larger panel data set ``PSID7682`` for the years 1976–1982,
      originating from Cornwell and Rupert (1988). Baltagi (2002) just
      uses the 1982 cross-section; hence ``PSID1982`` is available as a
      standalone data set because it was included in AER prior to the
      availability of the full ``PSID7682`` panel version.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source

      The data is from Baltagi (2002).

      .. code:: R

         data("PSID1982")
         plot(density(PSID1982$wage, bw = "SJ"))

         ## Baltagi (2002), Table 4.1
         earn_lm <- lm(log(wage) ~ . + I(experience^2), data = PSID1982)
         summary(earn_lm)

         ## Baltagi (2002), Table 13.1
         union_lpm <- lm(I(as.numeric(union) - 1) ~ . - wage, data = PSID1982)
         union_probit <- glm(union ~ . - wage, data = PSID1982, family = binomial(link = "probit"))
         union_logit <- glm(union ~ . - wage, data = PSID1982, family = binomial)
         ## probit OK, logit and LPM rather different.
