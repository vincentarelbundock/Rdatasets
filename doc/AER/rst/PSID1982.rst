   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   ``PSID1982`` is the cross-section for the year 1982 taken from a
   larger panel data set ``PSID7682`` for the years 1976–1982,
   originating from Cornwell and Rupert (1988). Baltagi (2002) just uses
   the 1982 cross-section; hence ``PSID1982`` is available as a
   standalone data set because it was included in AER prior to the
   availability of the full ``PSID7682`` panel version.

   .. rubric:: Source
      :name: source

   The data is from Baltagi (2002).

      data("PSID1982")
      plot(density(PSID1982$wage, bw = "SJ"))

      ## Baltagi (2002), Table 4.1
      earn_lm <- lm(log(wage) ~ . + I(experience^2), data = PSID1982)
      summary(earn_lm)

      ## Baltagi (2002), Table 13.1
      union_lpm <- lm(I(as.numeric(union) - 1) ~ . - wage, data = PSID1982)
      union_probit <- glm(union ~ . - wage, data = PSID1982, family = binomial(link = "probit"))
      union_logit <- glm(union ~ . - wage, data = PSID1982, family = binomial)
      ## probit OK, logit and LPM rather different.
