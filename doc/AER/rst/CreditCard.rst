      According to Greene (2003, p. 952) ``dependents`` equals
      ``1 + number of dependents``, our calculations suggest that it
      equals ``number of dependents``.

      Greene (2003) provides this data set twice in Table F21.4 and
      F9.1, respectively. Table F9.1 has just the observations, rounded
      to two digits. Here, we give the F21.4 version, see the examples
      for the F9.1 version. Note that ``age`` has some suspiciously low
      values (below one year) for some applicants. One of these differs
      between the F9.1 and F21.4 version.

         data("CreditCard")

         ## Greene (2003)
         ## extract data set F9.1
         ccard <- CreditCard[1:100,]
         ccard$income <- round(ccard$income, digits = 2)
         ccard$expenditure <- round(ccard$expenditure, digits = 2)
         ccard$age <- round(ccard$age + .01)
         ## suspicious:
         CreditCard$age[CreditCard$age < 1]
         ## the first of these is also in TableF9.1 with 36 instead of 0.5:
         ccard$age[79] <- 36

         ## Example 11.1
         ccard <- ccard[order(ccard$income),]
         ccard0 <- subset(ccard, expenditure > 0)
         cc_ols <- lm(expenditure ~ age + owner + income + I(income^2), data = ccard0)

         ## Figure 11.1
         plot(residuals(cc_ols) ~ income, data = ccard0, pch = 19)

         ## Table 11.1
         mean(ccard$age)
         prop.table(table(ccard$owner))
         mean(ccard$income)

         summary(cc_ols)
         sqrt(diag(vcovHC(cc_ols, type = "HC0")))
         sqrt(diag(vcovHC(cc_ols, type = "HC2"))) 
         sqrt(diag(vcovHC(cc_ols, type = "HC1")))

         bptest(cc_ols, ~ (age + income + I(income^2) + owner)^2 + I(age^2) + I(income^4), data = ccard0)
         gqtest(cc_ols)
         bptest(cc_ols, ~ income + I(income^2), data = ccard0, studentize = FALSE)
         bptest(cc_ols, ~ income + I(income^2), data = ccard0)
