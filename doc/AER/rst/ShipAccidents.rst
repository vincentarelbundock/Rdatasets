         data("ShipAccidents")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame containing 40 observations on 5 ship types in 4
      vintages and 2 service periods.

      type
         factor with levels ``"A"`` to ``"E"`` for the different ship
         types,

      construction
         factor with levels ``"1960-64"``, ``"1965-69"``, ``"1970-74"``,
         ``"1975-79"`` for the periods of construction,

      operation
         factor with levels ``"1960-74"``, ``"1975-79"`` for the periods
         of operation,

      service
         aggregate months of service,

      incidents
         number of damage incidents.

      .. rubric:: Details

      The data are from McCullagh and Nelder (1989, p. 205, Table 6.2)
      and were also used by Greene (2003, Ch. 21), see below.

      There are five ships (observations 7, 15, 23, 31, 39) with an
      operation period *before* the construction period, hence the
      variables ``service`` and ``incidents`` are necessarily 0. An
      additional observation (34) has entries representing *accidentally
      empty cells* (see McCullagh and Nelder, 1989, p. 205).

      It is a bit unclear what exactly the above means. In any case, the
      models are fit only to those observations with ``service > 0``.
