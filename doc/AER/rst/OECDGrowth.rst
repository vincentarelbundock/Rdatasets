      A data frame with 22 observations on the following 6 variables.

      gdp85
         real GDP in 1985 (per person of working age, i.e., age 15 to
         65), in 1985 international prices.

      gdp60
         real GDP in 1960 (per person of working age, i.e., age 15 to
         65), in 1985 international prices.

      invest
         average of annual ratios of real domestic investment to real
         GDP (1960–1985).

      school
         percentage of the working-age population that is in secondary
         school.

      randd
         average of annual ratios of gross domestic expenditure on
         research and development to nominal GDP (of available
         observations during 1960–1985).

      popgrowth
         annual population growth 1960–1985, computed as
         ``log(pop85/pop60)/25``.

      Appendix 1 Nonneman and Vanhoudt (1996), except for one bad
      misprint: The value of ``school`` for Norway is given as 0.01, the
      correct value is 0.1 (see Mankiw, Romer and Weil, 1992).
      ``OECDGrowth`` contains the corrected data.
