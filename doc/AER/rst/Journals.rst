      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Data on 180 economic journals, collected in particular for
      analyzing journal pricing. See also
      https://econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Journals/jpricing.html for general
      information on this topic as well as a more up-to-date version of
      the data set. This version is taken from Stock and Watson (2007).

      The data as obtained from the online complements for Stock and
      Watson (2007) contained two journals with title “World
      Development”. One of these (observation 80) seemed to be an error
      and was changed to “The World Economy”.

      .. rubric:: Source
         :name: source
