      A data frame containing 254,654 (and 30,000, respectively)
      observations on 8 variables.

      morekids
         factor. Does the mother have more than 2 children?

      gender1
         factor indicating gender of first child.

      gender2
         factor indicating gender of second child.

      age
         age of mother at census.

      afam
         factor. Is the mother African-American?

      hispanic
         factor. Is the mother Hispanic?

      other
         factor. Is the mother's ethnicity neither African-American nor
         Hispanic, nor Caucasian? (see below)

      work
         number of weeks in which the mother worked in 1979.

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      ``Fertility2`` is a random subset of ``Fertility`` with 30,000
      observations.

      There are conflicts in the ethnicity coding (see also examples).
      Hence, it was not possible to create a single factor and the
      original three indicator variables have been retained.

      Not all variables from Angrist and Evans (1998) have been
      included.
