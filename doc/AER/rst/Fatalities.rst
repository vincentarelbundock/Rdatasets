      Traffic fatalities are from the US Department of Transportation
      Fatal Accident Reporting System. The beer tax is the tax on a case
      of beer, which is an available measure of state alcohol taxes more
      generally. The drinking age variable is a factor indicating
      whether the legal drinking age is 18, 19, or 20. The two binary
      punishment variables describe the state's minimum sentencing
      requirements for an initial drunk driving conviction.

      Total vehicle miles traveled annually by state was obtained from
      the Department of Transportation. Personal income was obtained
      from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the unemployment rate
      was obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
