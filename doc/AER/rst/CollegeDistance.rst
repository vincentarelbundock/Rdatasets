      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      Rouse (1995) computed years of education by assigning 12 years to
      all members of the senior class. Each additional year of secondary
      education counted as a one year. Students with vocational degrees
      were assigned 13 years, AA degrees were assigned 14 years, BA
      degrees were assigned 16 years, those with some graduate education
      were assigned 17 years, and those with a graduate degree were
      assigned 18 years.

      Stock and Watson (2007) provide separate data files for the
      students from Western states and the remaining students.
      ``CollegeDistance`` includes both data sets, subsets are easily
      obtained (see also examples).
