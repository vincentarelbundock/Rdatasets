      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      The Massachusetts data are district-wide averages for public
      elementary school districts in 1998. The test score is taken from
      the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) test,
      administered to all fourth graders in Massachusetts public schools
      in the spring of 1998. The test is sponsored by the Massachusetts
      Department of Education and is mandatory for all public schools.
      The data analyzed here are the overall total score, which is the
      sum of the scores on the English, Math, and Science portions of
      the test. Data on the student-teacher ratio, the percent of
      students receiving a subsidized lunch and on the percent of
      students still learning english are averages for each elementary
      school district for the 1997â€“1998 school year and were obtained
      from the Massachusetts department of education. Data on average
      district income are from the 1990 US Census.
