      .. rubric:: Determinants of Wages Data (CPS 1988)
         :name: determinants-of-wages-data-cps-1988

      .. rubric:: Description
         :name: description

      Cross-section data originating from the March 1988 Current
      Population Survey by the US Census Bureau.

      .. rubric:: Usage
         :name: usage

      .. code:: R

         data("CPS1988")

      .. rubric:: Format
         :name: format

      A data frame containing 28,155 observations on 7 variables.

      wage
         Wage (in dollars per week).

      education
         Number of years of education.

      experience
         Number of years of potential work experience.

      ethnicity
         Factor with levels ``"cauc"`` and ``"afam"``
         (African-American).

      smsa
         Factor. Does the individual reside in a Standard Metropolitan
         Statistical Area (SMSA)?

      region
         Factor with levels ``"northeast"``, ``"midwest"``, ``"south"``,
         ``"west"``.

      parttime
         Factor. Does the individual work part-time?

      .. rubric:: Details
         :name: details

      A sample of men aged 18 to 70 with positive annual income greater
      than USD 50 in 1992, who are not self-employed nor working without
      pay. Wages are deflated by the deflator of Personal Consumption
      Expenditure for 1992.

      A problem with CPS data is that it does not provide actual work
      experience. It is therefore customary to compute experience as
      ``age - education - 6`` (as was done by Bierens and Ginther,
      2001), this may be considered potential experience. As a result,
      some respondents have negative experience.
