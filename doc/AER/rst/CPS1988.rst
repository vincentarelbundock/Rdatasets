   .. rubric:: Determinants of Wages Data (CPS 1988)
      :name: CPS1988

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Cross-section data originating from the March 1988 Current Population
   Survey by the US Census Bureau.

   .. code:: R

      data("CPS1988")

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame containing 28,155 observations on 7 variables.

   wage
      Wage (in dollars per week).

   education
      Number of years of education.

   experience
      Number of years of potential work experience.

   ethnicity
      Factor with levels ``"cauc"`` and ``"afam"`` (African-American).

   smsa
      Factor. Does the individual reside in a Standard Metropolitan
      Statistical Area (SMSA)?

   region
      Factor with levels ``"northeast"``, ``"midwest"``, ``"south"``,
      ``"west"``.

   parttime
      Factor. Does the individual work part-time?

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   A sample of men aged 18 to 70 with positive annual income greater
   than USD 50 in 1992, who are not self-employed nor working without
   pay. Wages are deflated by the deflator of Personal Consumption
   Expenditure for 1992.

   A problem with CPS data is that it does not provide actual work
   experience. It is therefore customary to compute experience as
   ``age - education - 6`` (as was done by Bierens and Ginther, 2001),
   this may be considered potential experience. As a result, some
   respondents have negative experience.
